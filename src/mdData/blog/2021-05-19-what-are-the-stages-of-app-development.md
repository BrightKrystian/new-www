**From an idea to a successful launch… There are 4 main stages of building an app. Learn more about all of them.**

**Web or mobile app development steps and timelines**

1. **App Idea**

   * Even the most unique idea doesn’t guarantee success. This is only the beginning.
   * **This phase helps quickly verify if the idea has some business potential.** For example, creating another weather app may not be a profitable option.
   * Also, during this stage, you can start looking for a suitable software development company.
   * Software development companies often conduct workshops with the client to discuss the idea and its potential.
   * This stage helps to answer another big question – how much would my app cost? If the idea is too expensive to develop, you can modify it or even just give up on it.
   * Ideation is a significant time for product designers. During workshops with the client, designers can better understand the whole solution. This brings us to the Prototyping phase.
2. **App Prototyping**

   (1-4 weeks)

   The stage when a product **designer creates the first visual representation of the idea**.
