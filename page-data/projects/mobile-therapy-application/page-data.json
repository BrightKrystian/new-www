As visits tend to be very short, it was crucial that the therapist and patients would be able to link their accounts in the app quickly. Naturally, not all patients already had the app when they came in, nor did everyone feel comfortable with using new technologies. Low levels of tech-savviness meant it was difficult for them to download the app, register an account, and – most importantly – link their profiles with those of therapists.</p>\n<p>We decided to solve the latter problem by automating the linking of patient-therapist profiles through a previously generated and printed code. This enables patients to link their accounts after the physiotherapy session is over, from the comfort of their homes. By inserting the code in the app, they’re now able to download their prescribed exercise plan.</p>\n<p>We also needed to create separate modules for patients and therapists.</p>\n<p>On the patient profile, one could download the therapy plan, as well as use the app on a daily basis for exercise and progress tracking. The patient’s app also features reminders and motivates the patient to continue on his/her path to recovery by displaying therapy statistics.</p>\n<p>The therapist panel was much more sophisticated. Firstly, it needed to allow therapists to customize plans for each patient. They also needed to plan out exercise sessions on a calendar and include information on the number of circuits per each exercise. Additionally, they needed an option to store photos and videos recorded during the patient’s therapeutic session. Alternatively, they were also to choose from a library of tutorial videos stored in the CMS.</p>\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Our work with the client lasted until the MVP was built and refined. The entire cooperation took place for half a year. Six months later, our clients put up the app for sale. Quickly, an interested party decided to order an audit of the software before making an offer. Upon a positive review of the service, the company decided to finalize their purchase and are now developing the app with an in-house development team.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"mobile-therapy-application","title":"Mobile Therapy Application","description":"An app that supports patients going through physiotherapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy in getting back to health."}}},"pageContext":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/projects/mobile-therapy-application.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
