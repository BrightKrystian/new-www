From the day zero a dedicated small team has been assigned to work on the Wahoo Fitness integration aspects. In parallel, two workshops with the customer representatives (held in Gdansk and London) led to the identification of the features supporting key business needs and the creation of prioritised requirements spec. It was clear from the beginning that some of the lower priority features wouldn’t make it to the first version of the product.</p>\n<p>A semi-professional internal Motivo Cycling Team was established and tasked with testing the alpha and beta versions of the upcoming product. They took on the challenge of including the Motivo app in their daily training, often doing extra exercises just to validate the app. In retrospect, the product would have never happened if it hadn’t been for the feedback collected from the Motivo Cycling Team.</p>\n<p>A highly iterative approach was taken with regards to user interface. Two most important screens (calendar and workout) were designed in a few different variations and the experiments conducted with the cyclist team helped decide on the one finally picked for the public release.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/e2d3b/motivo-1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.05405405405405%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Cycling Workouts Mobile App\"\n        title=\"Cycling Workouts Mobile App\"\n        src=\"/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/fcda8/motivo-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/12f09/motivo-1.png 148w,\n/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/e4a3f/motivo-1.png 295w,\n/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/fcda8/motivo-1.png 590w,\n/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/efc66/motivo-1.png 885w,\n/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/c83ae/motivo-1.png 1180w,\n/static/6aa0df07557d8bf3b1fa9dfd03c4ab30/e2d3b/motivo-1.png 1466w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Launch</h2>\n<p>The AppStore launch in January 2015 was supported by an advertising campaign that included ads in the UK sport press.
