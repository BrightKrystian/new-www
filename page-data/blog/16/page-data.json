Do you know what really makes your client satisfied? Tons of unit tests? Advanced integration tests running on every machine using Docker? Dozens of thousands of lines of a well-formatted, clean code? Or maybe a new open source library that every programmer is talking about? Actually, none of them.

This is also true for Android projects, especially the ones aimed at short time to market. For me, one of the most crucial time savers is the gradle-play-publisher plugin, which allows me to publish the APKs as soon as the build is finished.

We believe it can, as long as the dashboard is used by a few users. As this was our case, we have decided to give it a go.  As we were developing the dashboard, adding more statistics, more details and more features, it was getting slower and slower.
