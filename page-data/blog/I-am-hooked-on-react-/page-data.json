We don't need to write a separate class for that.\nLet's create a simple counter state-less component and add first Hook.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">export const Counter = () => {\n   return (\n       &#x3C;div>\n           &#x3C;p>Counter value: &#x3C;/p>\n           &#x3C;button onClick={}>Increase&#x3C;/button>\n           &#x3C;button onClick={}>Decrease&#x3C;/button>\n       &#x3C;/div>\n   )\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's the simple Counter. Our counter will increase and decrease the value if user presses Button <code>onClick</code> event.</p>\n<p>The way it works, you can pass the initial state as a first argument, in my case it will be count equal 0. </p>\n<pre><code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>useState</code> Hook returns an array. The first entry of the array is the the current value of the state, at this point it will be 0. The second entry of the array is a function to update the state.</p>\n<p>Now, we can pass the current value of the state and function for update the state:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">export const Counter = () => {\n   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n   return (\n       &#x3C;div>\n           &#x3C;p>Counter value: {count}&#x3C;/p>\n           &#x3C;button onClick={() => {setCount(count + 1)}}>Increase counter&#x3C;/button>\n           &#x3C;button onClick={() => {setCount(count -1)}}>Decrease counter&#x3C;/button>\n       &#x3C;/div>\n   )\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>useEffect</h3>\n<p>Hook as ability to avoid the side effects from the function component. It is almost the same like well-known <code>componentDidMount</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate</code>.</p>\n<p>So, simply we wll import and add it to our Counter, and pass an anonymous function as a first argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\nconst [checked, changeCheckbox] = useState(true)\nuseEffect(() => {\n   console.log('hello from useEffect')\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>For now, the text <code>hello from useEffect</code> will render every time when we change the current value of checkbox (so every time when function flushes changes to the DOM including the first render). </p>\n<p>The real power of <code>useEffect</code> is that we can pass a second optional argument, which is an array. Then we can specify that we want to invoke this effect only in the situation when we change the count value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">useEffect(() => {\n   console.log('hello from useEffect')\n}, [count])\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, the <code>useEffect</code> <strong>will be called only in case that the state of the count will change</strong>. Cool, right?</p>\n<h3>useContext</h3>\n<p>Imagine, the problem is that the name and surname of user from an index file is passed down as a prop to the components. </p>\n<p>We are going to create two additional function components: <code>Header</code> and <code>LoginInfo</code>. The components will only render the value passed as a <code>prop</code> from the <code>Dashboard</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Dashboard</code> which actually does not use it, just passed it down to <code>Header</code> which uses the value from the user state and passes it as well to <code>LoginInfo</code> which also renders the name of the user.\nThis approach is ok, but we have to pass a user through a bunch of components (in our case <code>Dashboard</code> which doesn't care about it). </p>\n<p>One way to make it looks better is to use <code>createContext</code>, to create a new context and returns the current context value, as given by the nearest context provider for the given context.\nSo let's create and export the <code>Context</code> object:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from 'react'\nconst Context = React.createContext()\nexport default Context\n</code></pre>\n<p>In our index app, we are importing the Context and wrap the whole main page component with <code>&#x3C;Context.Provider></code> and pass the user value from state as a prop. Now, we have an access to all of the\nContext consumers to the value from state and we don’t need to pass it through the components as a prop.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport { Dashboard } from \"./Dashboard\";\nimport Context from './Context'\n\nclass App extends Component {\n   state = {\n       user: 'John Doe'\n   }\n   render() {\n       const {user} = this.state\n       return (\n           &#x3C;Context.Provider value={user}>\n               &#x3C;Dashboard />\n           &#x3C;/Context.Provider>\n       );\n   }\n}\nexport default App;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Right now, we use <code>useContext</code> Hook and wrap our Context, where the value is a value passed from the Provider (our index). Let's assign in to user variable.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { useContext } from 'react'\nimport LoginInfo from './LoginInfo'\nimport Context from './Context'\n\nconst Header = () => {\n    const user = useContext(Context)\n    return (\n        &#x3C;div>\n            &#x3C;h1>Welcome {user}&#x3C;/h1>\n            &#x3C;LoginInfo />\n        &#x3C;/div>\n\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n</code></pre>\n<p>The situation will be the same for the <code>LoginInfo</code>. We declare a value <code>user</code> by using <code>useContext</code> Hook and the value is a value passed from the Provider (our index).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { useContext } from 'react'\nimport Context from './Context'\n\nconst LoginInfo = () => {\n    const user = useContext(Context)\n    return (\n        &#x3C;h6>Logged as {user}&#x3C;/h6>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default LoginInfo\n</code></pre>\n<p>In <code>LoginInfo</code> and <code>Header</code> now we have prop user as a value, so we can remove the unnecessary prop from the <code>Dashboard</code> which doesn't use it at all. </p>\n<h1>React Hooks restrictions</h1>\n<p>Although it looks nicely, it's really good to know about Hooks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hooks can be only called from React function component,</li>\n<li>Hooks should be only called on the top level. Don't call them inside loops, conditions or nested functions. By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time as component renders. That's what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> calls. (For more if you are curious, good explain is <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation\">here</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Class base component will be no more support?</h1>\n<p>I think that Hooks and class base components will be still useful. The documentation says that <strong>\"There are no plans to remove classes from React\"</strong> and they definitely do not recommend rewriting everything into Hooks. It's individual and you should decide whether use Hooks or Classes.</p>\n<p>Hooks are great feature in React. Personally, I'm using it after stable version release.</p>","excerpt":"React has introduced a new feature which allows you to use state and other React feature without writing class, upcoming Hooks, a new…","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":"I am hooked on React","description":null,"author":"patryk","tags":["React","JavaScript","Hooks"],"date":"2019-03-12T23:00:00.000Z","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/224fd/intro.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/26644/intro.jpg 1368w,\n/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/d0a5a/intro.jpg 2736w,\n/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/224fd/intro.jpg 5472w","sizes":"(min-width: 5472px) 5472px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/4061d/intro.webp 1368w,\n/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/0fe32/intro.webp 2736w,\n/static/f32cf78643b7ca71d5daa606011ca726/34b1a/intro.webp 5472w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 5472px) 5472px, 100vw"}]},"width":5472,"height":3648}}}},"timeToRead":6,"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-03-13-I-am-hooked-on-react-.md"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://brightinventions.pl"}}},"pageContext":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-03-13-I-am-hooked-on-react-.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2189233960","3181594896"]}
