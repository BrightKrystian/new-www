So I've found a pretty nice project, called ESPBASIC. I heard about BASIC, but I had  never had a chance neither to learn it nor to use it, so I thought it was 's time to meet BASIC (although it's just an interpreter). I have few ESP-12F chips in my drawer, few cables and LEDs scattered around and a free breadboard, and that will be enough for the first encounter with BASIC.
