I find Rex pretty helpful when working with ReactiveCocoa, especially creating UI bindings. If you are binding your view model with UI layer, Rex will let you do it much easier with it's extensions to UIControls. Here are some examples of Rex usage. UIButton UITextField, UILabel, MutableProperty You can clearly see that Rex makes our bindings much easier to read and understand.
