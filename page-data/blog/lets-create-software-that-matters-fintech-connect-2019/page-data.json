We will share best practices, showcase new solutions and shape financial services of the future. </p>\n<p><strong>If you are heading over to London, make sure you visit us at ExCeL London, the booth F30, and chat with our team.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to book a meeting with our technical team who will attend the event, please send us an email to</strong> <a href=\"mailto:mateusz@bright.dev\"><strong>mateusz@bright.dev</strong> </a></p>\n<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>\n<p>Bright Inventions is a consultancy and software development studio based in Gdańsk, Poland. Throughout the years, we’ve made a name for ourselves in a whole array of services, including idea consulting, product design, software development, IoT and Blockchain.</p>\n<p>The company was established in 2012, when the Founders, Michał Łukasiewicz and Daniel Makurat, decided to create a place where innovative individuals and companies could turn to develop their  ideas – all without tedious bureaucracy and formalities, the place where the team will be able to focus on creating software solutions that matter. </p>\n<h2><strong>Our projects</strong></h2>\n<p>Throughout the years, we’ve been blessed with the opportunity to work on projects of the worldwide impact – both directly with the client and in the white-label model. </p>\n<p>Most prominently, we’ve been entrusted by a global humanitarian organization with the development of a Blockchain-based transaction system which aims at obliterating world hunger. </p>\n<p>We’ve also helped bring an innovative emergency &#x26; rescue app into the market, as well as developed revolutionary, Android-based point-of-sales software for a world-leading food delivery ordering company.</p>\n<h2>Our values</h2>\n<p>At Bright Inventions, we’re truly invested in each project – just as if they were our own. This means that in our work with clients we’re not driven by financial gains, nor do we take on all projects.</p>\n<p>When a potential customer turns to us with an idea, we put our hearts and souls into testing it against the competition and market needs. If we believe a project should not be developed due to its low chances of success, we offer our guidance and verify if there’s room for a promising pivot.</p>\n<p>This all comes down to the fact that “Bright Inventions” is more than just our brand name. It’s also a term that truly reflects who we are and what we do.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are looking for a long-term partner who will help you build reliable and scalable software systems, talk to our team and find out more about how we work. Remember that your project is our project - we always share with you ideas for the best possible outcomes.</strong></p>","excerpt":"On 3-4 Dec we will be attending FinTech Connect, the UK's leading fintech conference and exhibition that gathers the companies…","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":"Let's create software that matters, Fintech Connect 2019 ","description":null,"author":"ula","tags":["blockchain","fintech connect","mobile","web","IoT"],"date":"2019-11-26T08:14:28.083Z","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#785848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/a6312/ltscreatefintech3.png","srcSet":"/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/e20c6/ltscreatefintech3.png 300w,\n/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/62ea7/ltscreatefintech3.png 600w,\n/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/a6312/ltscreatefintech3.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/b979a/ltscreatefintech3.webp 300w,\n/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/2fa07/ltscreatefintech3.webp 600w,\n/static/924cb85db62ec13bb136363b07a3449c/f9756/ltscreatefintech3.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":600}}}},"timeToRead":2,"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-11-26-lets-create-software-that-matters-fintech-connect-2019.md"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://brightinventions.pl"}}},"pageContext":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2019-11-26-lets-create-software-that-matters-fintech-connect-2019.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2189233960","3181594896"]}
