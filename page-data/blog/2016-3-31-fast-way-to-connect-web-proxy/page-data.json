You don't care about typing <em>IP</em> address and port.</li>\n<li>Installs <em>CA</em> certificate at runtime. You don't have to install it by hand on the device. You don't even have to have password for credential storage ;)</li>\n<li>Because the device isn't directly connected, the web proxy can see traffic from your app only (other apps' traffic isn't visible).</li>\n<li>You can dynamically enable/disable the proxy for <em>HTTP</em> client in runtime so you can pass some requests over the proxy. </li>\n<li>It's safer. You don't install proxy or any third party certificate on the system directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n# Let's code it.\n<p>Add this task on the top of <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-groovy\">ext{\n    proxy = 'cannot.get.buildmachine.local.ip'\n}\n\ntask getBuildMachineLocalIp() {\n    def stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream()\n    exec{\n        executable \"sh\"\n        args \"-c\", 'ifconfig en1 | grep \"inet \" | awk \\'{ print $2}\\''\n        standardOutput = stdout\n    }\n    project.ext.proxy = stdout.toString().trim()\n    println \"build machine local ip: \" + project.ext.proxy\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It gets local <em>IP</em> address of your desktop build machine and store it in <code>project.ext.proxy</code>.<br/>\nRemember to replace <code>ifconfig</code> command with proper <code>ipconfig</code> if your build machine is running Windows.<br/>\nYou have to also ensure that <code>en1</code> is the interface used to connect to the same wifi network as Android device.</p>\n<p>Now, make above task depended on <code>preBuild</code> Android's task to run it on the beginning of the build process:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-groovy\">android{\n    defaultConfig{\n        buildConfigField 'String', 'BUILD_MACHINE_LOCAL_IP', '\\\"' + project.ext.proxy + \"\\\"\"\n    }\n}\ndependencies{\n    ...\n}\n\npreBuild.dependsOn getBuildMachineLocalIp\n</code></pre>\n<p>I made one more thing here. <br/>\nCopied value of <code>project.ext.proxy</code> to <code>BuildConfig.BUILD_MACHINE_LOCAL_IP</code> to have access to <em>IP</em> address in code.</p>\n<p>The last part is to set up our proxy for <em>HTTP</em> client.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">private void setProxy(OkHttpClient client) {\n    if (FeatureToggle.PROXY_ENABLED &#x26;&#x26; BuildConfig.BUILD_TYPE.equals(\"debug\")) {\n        client.setProxy(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(BuildConfig.BUILD_MACHINE_LOCAL_IP, 8888)));\n        SSLContext sslContext = SslUtils.getSslContextForCertificateFile(app, \"charles-proxy-ssl-proxying-certificate.crt\");\n        client.setSslSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());\n        LOG.debug(\"proxy set for client {}\", client);\n    }\n}\n\nOkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();\nsetProxy(client);\n\n/*\nuse client as you wish eg. with Retrofit\n*/\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's simple <code>if</code> statement which enables proxy when flag is active.<br/>\nProbably, you don't want to have the proxy connection for release builds so I also check build type here.<br/>\nThe last thing is to set up <em>CA</em> certificate of the web proxy to make <em>HTTP</em> connections visible on it. <br/>\n<code>SslUtils</code> is simple helper class which I created to trust given certificate despite system settings. <br/>\nYou can read about <code>SslUtils</code> in <a href=\"http://blog.brightinventions.pl/trust-specific-certificate-on-jvm/\">this post</a> and download it from <a href=\"https://github.com/mklimek/ssl-utils-android\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have any tips or thoughts about this method, let me know about it :)</p>\n<p>See this post on my <a href=\"https://mklimek.github.io/fast-way-to-connect-web-proxy/\">personal blog</a>.</p>","excerpt":"Configuring Android device to connect to the web proxy running on development build machine is tedious.\nYou have to make the same steps overâ€¦","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":"A fast way to connect to the web proxy","description":null,"author":"mateuszklimek","tags":["android"],"date":"2016-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","image":null},"timeToRead":3,"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2016-3-31-fast-way-to-connect-web-proxy.md"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://brightinventions.pl"}}},"pageContext":{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2016-3-31-fast-way-to-connect-web-proxy.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2189233960","3181594896"]}
