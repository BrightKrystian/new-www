In 1978 J.M. Darley and C.D. Batson constructed the experiment in which they tested the possible facts behind the modern version of the parable of Good Samaritan concerning altruistic behaviours. The experiment showed that the major reason why people didn’t stop to offer some help to a victim was the haste of their lives. There were different groups of people involved in the experiment, but the most…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":null,"comments":true,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/a6b45/more_productivity.jpg","srcSet":"/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/dccce/more_productivity.jpg 338w,\n/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/a5f55/more_productivity.jpg 676w,\n/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/a6b45/more_productivity.jpg 1351w","sizes":"(min-width: 1351px) 1351px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/1818c/more_productivity.webp 338w,\n/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/91d6b/more_productivity.webp 676w,\n/static/de26cf7fac43233b4538bc370dea1e1b/5c83f/more_productivity.webp 1351w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1351px) 1351px, 100vw"}]},"width":1351,"height":901}}},"author":"ula","author_id":null,"title":"Four thieves of your productivity","tags":["motivation","work","time management","productivity"],"date":"2020-11-03T13:24:40.469Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-11-04-four-thieves-of-your-productivity"}}},{"node":{"id":"281d79cb-ab69-5700-a5e4-fbaf4ae50e10","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2020-10-06-an-ode-to-product-mindset-and-developers-who-know-how-to-ride-a-bike.md","excerpt":"Companies mostly work “in projects” these days.
