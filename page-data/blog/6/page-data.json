It allows us to understand the market opportunities, improve our communication skills, make great friends and build business opportunities and investment in the long term. During my first months at Bright Inventions, I have spent a lot of time attending educational and inspiring conferences and trade shows in London. Which are worth visiting? Let us…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":"Networking gives you the chance to connect with new highly influential people easily, people who wouldn’t connect with you just through a cold email or a LinkedIn invitation. It’s a chance where you can build long term business relationships and to strengthen the relationship with old connections which could formulate into business growth. Not only can you build new connections but also the ability to gain new knowledge and receive advice that you were not able to get a hold off. Some people feel stressed, nervous about networking and speaking to new people, don’t be, just be yourself and have fun.","comments":null,"image":null,"author":"agnieszka_h","author_id":null,"title":"Bright Networking Time","tags":["networking","business","startups","cooperation"],"date":"2018-12-18T23:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-12-19-bright-networking-time"}}},{"node":{"id":"89194fd3-34b5-5809-8d13-2c190be9e8c4","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2018-11-19-dont-let-your-mind-steal-your-time.md","excerpt":"Josh Billings, or if you prefer - Henry Wheeler Shaw, said once that \"the greatest thief this world has ever produced is procrastination, and he is still at large\". I am rather a well-organised person and I try not to delay anything. To be honest, there are rarely moments that I put off things that I have to do. Sometimes I just prioritise and do other things first. I just do not like the feeling when there are some open ideas floating around in my mind. I have to clear it as soon as possible…","frontmatter":{"excerpt":"Procrastination can often make our lives miserable. It  steals our time, money, and first of all satisfaction. So, what can we do not to let this powerful thief steal the greatness of our life? One may think it is not a question for me since I am quite disciplined and I rather do not face such problems. The reality is a bit different. Of course, I usually have a schedule that I follow, but apart from that I apply also a few rules that help me stay focused and engaged.","comments":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/1866a/do_it_now.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/60385/do_it_now.jpg 213w,\n/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/e6c7b/do_it_now.jpg 426w,\n/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/1866a/do_it_now.jpg 851w","sizes":"(min-width: 851px) 851px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/c4a0c/do_it_now.webp 213w,\n/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/b188d/do_it_now.webp 426w,\n/static/dc3520a7e42259ab8a34348dabd860ce/f3c4c/do_it_now.webp 851w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 851px) 851px, 100vw"}]},"width":851,"height":315}}},"author":"ula","author_id":null,"title":"Don't let your mind steal your time","tags":["productivity","tips","procrastination","work"],"date":"2018-11-18T23:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-11-19-dont-let-your-mind-steal-your-time"}}},{"node":{"id":"2805e0e5-5539-5e9e-8f91-df01d847bd3d","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/new-www/new-www/src/mdData/blog/2018-09-12-definition-of-done.md","excerpt":"I have often heard that something is \"almost ready\".
