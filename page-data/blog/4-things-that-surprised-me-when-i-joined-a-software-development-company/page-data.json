Slack is the new email</h2>\n<p>I love Slack. I was introduced to it a few years ago and I fell in love with it instantly. Although, I think that the Slack team should work harder on GIF finder feature… Nevertheless, I simply love Slack. However, here at <a href=\"https://brightinventions.pl\">Bright Inventions</a> they loooove Slack! We have over 80 channels regarding everything: our passions, work, self-development and of course… food ordering! My favourite channels are: #todayilearned, #bright-kudos and #random – because there is no Slack without some random stories ;) What struck me the most is that I barely use email anymore. My Gmail is practically empty! I remember like 5 years ago email was the most important tool to communicate in and outside the team. Recently, I’ve realised how that has changed. And you know what? I love it! </p>\n<h2>2. Ask me anything</h2>\n<p>Q&#x26;As are something that I enjoyed mostly when I watched my favourite YouTubers answering fans questions. I have never thought that it could be implemented into the work environment. At Bright we have regular Q&#x26;As with our co-founders and managers. They answer questions that were previously sent anonymously by members of the team. I think it is a really smart way to address possible issues or simply questions within the team. Also, as it turns out it is a great way to learn more about the origin of the company. Actually one of the most popular employee’s questions is: ‘How it all started?’.</p>\n<h2>3. Developers read books</h2>\n<p>Let’s be clear. I know that developers read books! But I didn't know that they read books about technologies. I used to think that the books about Python or C# can never be up-to-date. However, at Bright Inventions we have a little library with books not only touching on technology but also team management, agile or design. For sure, everyone will find something interesting in our collection.</p>\n<h2>4. Friday yoga</h2>\n<p>I’ve never been a yoga fan. But you know what? Group yoga conducted by a nice instructor on Friday afternoon (only a few hours before the weekend) works perfectly. It is a great start to the weekend. Of course, this is not mandatory. If you want, you can join. If you don't, you just do your things. </p>\n<p>These are 4 things that have surprised me at a software development company. No doubt that there are more surprises to come in the future… So I am happy to stick around!</p>","excerpt":"I am not a developer.
