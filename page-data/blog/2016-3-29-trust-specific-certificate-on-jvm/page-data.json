If you want to ship an app with support to such CA and don't want to force a user to install it himself you can add that CA to the app at runtime. Totally transparent to the user.</li>\n<li>Security reasons. No need to install third party certs on the system directly. Eg. during development phase server might be certified by temporarily <code>ssh-development-only-certificate.cer</code>. No one should trust it except development-phase client app.\nThe second case: you want to use the web proxy. It's also risky to install proxy certificate for the whole system.</li>\n<li>You have no rights to add proper CA to the system. You told about it your administrator but you're still waiting or worse, he refuses.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Warning: Copy and Paste</h1>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/mklimek/f9d197362c1f2db8c1b76f76ace75859.js\"></script>\n<h1>Example usage</h1>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/mklimek/a623509f2c0a99096a4bc0bd71f7bf62.js\"></script>\n<p>You can easily adopt that code in any JVM language like Groovy, Kotlin, etc.<br/>\nOn Android you can load certificate from assets.
