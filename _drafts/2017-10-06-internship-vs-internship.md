Hello! I’m Radek and I am a programmer. Employed as a full-time software developer at Bright Inventions… last Monday.

There’s plenty of ways to become a programmer. But when you’re studying Computer Science at the University of Technology there’s  99% chance you get an internship in IT long before graduating and quickly after a few months - a job. Like I could. I went through two internships, both at seemingly similar companies. After first one I got an offer to work full-time or part-time, whatever would be more convenient for me to combine my work with studies. I said... no. After the second internship, I couldn’t be happier when I got an offer.

What differs these two?

Everything.


Dear CEO, how-to run an internship.
====

1\. Don’t give Interns made up projects.
---
Whoa, who does that? Seriously, I got this feeling that it's studies all over again. I didn't come to this job for playing in the sandbox. What’s the reason for that? If you think I’m not good enough for working with a professional project for the client so why did you even employed me? There is a significant difference between safe environment for me to learn and some kind of weird incubator with a sign above the door "Future Developer Farm, DO NOT TAP THE GLASS". The project itself was theoretically really interesting, I had some ideas and opinions about it, but after few weeks I asked myself... what for? It's highly demotivating knowing your work will be thrown to trash after finishing it and no one will ever use it. At Bright, on the other hand, I was put in the real project on the first day. Not alone of course, but it was a clear message that my work is necessary what filled my motivation bank to the top level. It's really important.


2\. Pay them well and treat with respect.
---
I'm not saying I was treated badly in any way at my first work. But let's clear something up - smiles on the hallway, friendly talks from time to time and even being open for your opinion about the project cannot cover the fact, that you If you get the lousy money you feel lousy. And it's not even about how you feel as a person in the company because it affects every life zone. Beginning as an intern from lowest levels in the company hierarchy comes with the small payment, sure. But 15% of average Junior JS Developer salary? You simply can't expect it will satisfy anyone, even if it's a student with no professional experience. And don't even try with unpaid internships.


3\. Sensitize other employees to be helpful and available for interns.
---
If you want me to learn, I will. But mostly from betters. If you put me in a group of interns only, how can we develop our skills and avoid bad practices in programming? In most cases, there is no way we could learn that from tutorials and figure it out by ourselves. The main purpose of the internship is to fill the small, but the meaningful gap between developing a project for grades and for the client. We need the code reviews, we need feedback and we need it from the very first day. Not only for your final product to be better but for us, so WE could become better. It's a win-win! And if you cannot designate one person for reviews, think of it as an investment. It will pay off, you have my word. Sensitize others to be helpful, at least a few ones. At Bright they know that, duh, I got this feeling I could ask anyone for help and not get ignored, even after asking a hundredth question. Based on experience from the previous company it was pretty surprising.


4\. Don’t try to be a corporation if you ain’t one.
---
Honestly, I don't know what makes the company a corporation. But what I know is it needs something more to evaluate the value of the employee than a report with fancy charts and official meetings where they confess their code. I've seen my colleagues had to explain on the summary meeting why their work cannot be seen on the frontend side of the project. Because they were doing backend and database... Summaries, regularisations, comparisons make you feel like irrelevant cog ready to be replaced at any moment.
First, understand the nature of the project. Second, talk to your interns. If you don't have time, then rely on people who do and trust their opinion. And unless you run a company with over 100 employees don't hide behind reports and numbers. They lie sometimes.


Summary
---
I’ve just finished my internship at Bright Inventions. Comparing it with previous one opened my eyes how working environment influences your attitude for work and motivation. You can start a new job, motivated for work with batteries fully charged, but what happens next depends not only on you.

Definitely.
