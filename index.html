    <p>Bright Inventions was founded in 2012 by two guys bored with corporate inertia and lack of fun. They knew that work could be fun, refreshing and approached with a happy attitude. Now in 2017 there are 11 of us and we are only starting. <br><br>

    We provide high-quality IT services by creating innovative mobile applications for iOS and Android and offer complex web solutions. Self-motivation, solidity and passion for development - that is what describes us best. Our approach always aims at thorough understanding of the problem and building unique solutions for best customer experience. We cover all phases from an idea to managed launch and maintenance. <br><br>

    Why do clients enjoy working with us? Because we are as results-driven as they are. Our success is measured by their success. We help businesses not only achieve, but even surpass their goals. <br><br>

    Since 2015 we have also a dedicated team which is responsible for Bid Data and Blockchain projects. Systems that we create provide users with advanced features and our clients appreciate their effectiveness and stability above all.</p>
