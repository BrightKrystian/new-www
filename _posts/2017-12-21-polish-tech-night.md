During my 4-days long trip to Berlin, I had a pleasure to participate in the 3rd edition of [Polish Tech Night](https://polishtechnight.com) as a member of  group led by [Gdański Inkubator Przdsiębiorczości Starter](http://www.inkubatorstarter.pl). Polish Tech Night is an event connecting Polish tech startups with German ecosystem, combined with numerous workshops on the plenty of subjects like business cooperation, venture capitals, or law aspects.

Bright Inventions is already experienced in working with startups, I'd even say that we've grown up on a cooperation with newly established high-tech companies. I've already successfully run several projects with startups founded in Germany, but my goal during my trip to Berlin was to understand better the needs of startups and the problems they are facing, experience their work environment and get inspired by the prevailing atmosphere of creativity and entrepreneurship.

## Startups

During the series of workshops I've learned plenty of interesting facts about Berlin startup ecosystem:

- 75% of German startups are located in Berlin
- Berlin takes the **7th place over the world** in a startups ecosystem ranking according to the [Startup Genome 2017 report](https://www.techinasia.com/startup-genome-startup-ecosystem-ranking-report-2017)
- In 2015, total venture capital fundings in Berlin were the **highest in the world**
- The development plan of the Berlin authorities is focused on **fintech** and **Internet of Things** (IoT) industries
- Despite this, still the most popular Berlin startup industry is e-commerce

Among the others, there were great speaker like:

- **Max Moldenhauer** and **Marcus Erken** from Sunfish Partners Venture Capital experienced in growing early-stage startups.
- **Bartek Gola** from SpeedUp venture capital group aiming in cooperation with companies in a long term investment horizon. SpeedUp group specializes in areas like consumer internet, fintech, martech, IoT and hardware.

The Evening part attracted crowds including numerous business people, startups, venture capital partners, and many other people associated with investment and technologies in Berlin. There were 7 interesting pitches presenting original ideas born in Polish startups. No to mention the networking part afterwards, which lasted until late evening hours.

## Tour around Berlin

To understand better the startups environment and experience the atmosphere on our own we visited 3 well-known Berlin co-work spaces:

- [Cube Berlin](http://cube-global.com)
- [Mindspace](https://www.mindspace.me/berlin)
- [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/l/berlin)

Beyond great views, especially in WeWork, these places provide complete infrastructure together with additional services and co-working atmosphere that any growing startup might need.

Besides workshops, pitches and visiting co-work spaces we also found some time for sightseeing.

## Great people

During those days I've learned a lot about startups ecosystem in Berlin and I had a chance to see how does it look like from the inside. However, what I found the most valuable from the entire trip, were the amazing people I've met. Starting from incredible Polish Tech Night organizers, that made a huge effort to organise such big event and host us during the whole 4 days.

The group that we set off from Gdańsk consisted of people of various talents and professions, including software development, business development, internet of things, sales, public relations, or business owners. Such collective of different personalities and skills allowed us to look at plenty topics from various points of view and hold interesting discussions all the time.

During this trip, I met many inspiring people and I learned a lot about startups running in Germany which I believe will help us address better our clients needs and improve even more the quality of our services.
