Push notifications, also known as remote notifications, are a tremendously useful feature of mobile applications. They can be used for sending users marketing offers, increase users engagement by providing a personalised content, implementing a chat or even triggering some action to be performed in the background. And what's really useful, users don't have to keep their app opened.

Sounds great, isn't it? But it's worth to understand how push notifications work and learn how to set them up properly to avoid unnecessary hassle.

## iOS 10 novelties

iOS 10, in addition to short text message, playing a notification sound, setting a budge number on the app's icon, has expanded iOS push notifications capabilities with sending **media** (images, gifs, audio, video), expanding detail view with **3D Touch** and **notifications actions** allowing user to take immediate actions.
