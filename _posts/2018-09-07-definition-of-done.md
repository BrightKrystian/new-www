I have often heard that something is "almost ready". According to the [Ninety-Ninety rule](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/dont-be-mockup-developer/#ninety-ninety-rule), 90% of the code is implemented in 90% of the project time and the remaining 10% of the code ("almost ready" features) can take even the same amount of time which will lead to massive project delays.

For this reason, I find determining the Definition of Done crucial for every project. Otherwise, you can only hum the Project Manager song:
>What is done?
>
>Devs don't hurt me
>
>Don't hurt me
>
>No more

## There is no single definition

DoD in agile...

## Synchronize

- work in progress
- implemented
- tested/reviewed
- deployed - done

## Win-Win
