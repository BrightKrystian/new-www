Getting into the world of software development can be a really demanding task. Introducing clean code, providing tests to your solution, using the right tool for the job, keeping up with latest trends... these are all things that you were most probably told about at the time that you barely entered the development world.  
But it seems that many people tend to neglect the side of development that hasn't got too much to do with machinces, however in the long run should be even more important to you as a developer.  


- Impostor syndrome  
As a developer (especially newcomer), you may often feel that your contributions to the project could be easily replaced by someone else who would surely do it faster and better. You may also feel that you've somehow cheated the interview process and it's just a matter of time before they find out that you are not qualified for the job. If you've actually achieved something, then well... maybe it was just... pure luck?  
It was a long time before I discovered, that this kind of feeling has psychological background and is something that many people suffer from. But a pure knowledge of the fact, that the whole thing has a psychological background will not magically remove all of your doubts. Please remember, that maybe the fact that a certain person is able to do a task faster is caused by the fact that he has more experience than you. Maybe the other person has already completed a certain task before? For a developer, learning is a common process of doing things and nobody will expect you to know everything upfront.

- Stress 
it's normal if you're responsible for something important, but is it ok if you're doing something that is not that harmful when broken?

- Social media
It's easy to get driven by a socialmedia flow of people posting their latest achievement. 

- Working over hours
There are times that it may help, but in most cases this is a wrong way

- Estimations


// What can I do?

- Shut access to mail

- Close your day 

- Find people that will support you

I know that the points that I've mentioned may barely touch the surface of the whole topic. // more awareness
