    <h2>Everytap</h2>
    <p>Everytap is an innovative loyalty program for iOS &amp; Android platforms using iBeacon technology for collecting and spending points and notifying user about new events and promotions.</p>
    <p>Bright Inventions bootstrapped the implementation on both platforms and provided the Ruby-on-Rails backend. Our work included - but was not limited to - plenty custom animations and UI effects as well as integrating push notifications, Google Maps and Facebook.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iOS: iBeacons, push notifications, custom animations</li>
        <li>Backend: Ruby-on-Rails, Heroku, MongoDB</li>
    </ul>
