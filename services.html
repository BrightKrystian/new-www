    <p>We always seek for exciting projects that satisfy our <em>hunger for technical challenges</em>.
Since 2012 we have realized many projects among which there was an application for sportsmen, solutions supporting eco-driving, POS cash register or system responsible for answering calls to emergency numbers.<br>  
We have a long-term experience in the systems integration, IoT solutions (sensors, readers, household appliances, wearables) and communication with Bluetooth devices.</p>
    <p>Our main focus are <em>mobile-centric solutions</em> that encompass:</p>
    <ul>
