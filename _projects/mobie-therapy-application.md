title: Therapy Application
description: For one of our clients we developed a health application which utilizes user's information to create their personal therapy plan. The application allows to create a continuous therapy process and mainatain a regular effective communication between therapists and their patients. It provides a professional guidance how often and what kind of exercsies users should do. Users can upload multiple photos and videos of exercises in the app as well as set up reminders and alarms. The application has two independent designs depeding on the user's role.
