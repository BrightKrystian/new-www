title: Everytap
description: Everytap is a Polish startup now backed by TVN Ventures VC. We not only bootstrapped the implementation on both platforms and provided the Ruby-on-Rails backend, but also helped its founders understand the customerâ€™s needs even before the idea was fully definite and clear. The realised project resulted is an innovative loyalty program for iOS & Android platforms using iBeacon technology for collecting and spending points and notifying users about new events and promotions in the shops and restaurants.
