Internet of Things is an integral part of the software development process for many industries. You may need an IoT provider especially when:

For our client vCare we have developed software that enables telemedicine. Our team have built software connecting with such devices as: Bluetooth thermometer, pulse oximeter and more.

We have worked with hardware for Fintech and we are ready to assist you with your fintech IoT project.
