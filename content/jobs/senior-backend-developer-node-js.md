We are looking forÂ **an experienced Backend Developer**Â who understands **TypeScript & Node.js** really well and who would like toÂ **work with AWS on daily basis**.

And what would you do? Develop and enhance innovative Card Tracking System based on web and mobile applications created to distribute debit cards and other payment instruments to people in critical situations in Asia and Africa. 

The system is developed on two platforms. The web application is used mainly to display logs of the events and current cards' statuses. Mobile application (on Android) enables scanning the cards, sending them between offices and distributing them to beneficiaries. 

The system was launched in 2020 in one of the countries in the Near East and it will be released soon in other countries in Asia and Africa. We constantly develop new features, offer maintenance and assist the client in launching the product in other countries. Therefore our focus remains on unifying the system so it could be adjusted to other countries' regulations. This project is a very rewarding experience for our team and we are extremely happy to develop it with the client.
