## who we are

We support and share responsibility with the members of our team. We also actively take responsibility for our own self-development. Positive attitude, flexibility and client orientation are crucial parts of our culture. 

## about the role and project **🧑🏻‍💻👩🏻‍💻**

**As a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), you will play a key role in ensuring the scalability, efficiency and reliability of production systems.** You will design, build and automate processes using various scripting languages to improve monitoring, deployments and overall system performance. 

**Project:** As part of this project we have been building an SDK for iOS and Android platforms for over 5 years that communicates with Bluetooth trackers while the app is running in the background. The basic functionality is to report the location of devices in the vicinity of the tracker. The operation is similar to the AirTag locator (location is encrypted, device identification data changes regularly), but the applications of the technology will be much different. The application can be used in industry, logistics or, for example, to open doors remotely.

## what you will do 🚀🚀🚀

* run infrastructure with Terraform, CI/CD and Kubernetes 
* handle production incidents
* develop the software tools and scripts to optimize the process
* help with the system scalability and reliability improvement
* keep systems secure and up-to-date
* have direct contact with clients and advise in their decision-making process
* share knowledge with the rest of the team

* good knowledge and experience with CI/CD
* experience with Kubernetes, Terraform and Docker in production
* experience in Cloud infrastructure - preferably AWS

* very good communication skills in English and Polish (both written and spoken)

## nice-to-haves

* experience with reliable multi-region architectures
* knowledge of TypeScript or Java/Kotlin

## what you will find in our Bright Team 🧡

* real impact on the implemented solutions and project growth
* continuous **feedback culture**
* **mentoring programme** and regular 1:1 meetings
* **flexible working hours** (we start between 7.00 -10.00 a.m.) 
* **20-26 paid days off** + extra days for Polish public holidays 
* **individual training budget** and office library 
* **MultiSport** card and **private medical** package
* good equipment: **MacBook**, one/ two screens and additional accessories
* Bright Day once a month for non-project stuff
* **free English** classes in small groups with a native speaker 
* weekly **running, swimming and cycling classes** with a professional coach

This is an opportunity to be part of a great ambitious team and to help us shape the future of software development solutions. Take it!
