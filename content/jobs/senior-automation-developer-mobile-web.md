We are a software development and consultancy studio based in GdaÅ„sk, Poland. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide, and have made a name for ourselves in a whole array of services: idea consulting, product design, software development, IoT, Blockchain, and more.

The project we will need your support at first is Practi - all-in-one operating system for restaurants that lets you manage all of your orders, including from delivery apps, from one place. More than just an EPOS, Practi does everything from taking customer orders in our tablet-based app to making menu changes in your virtual Back Office in the cloud with just a few clicks. From high-street chains to independent restaurants, market vendors and more, Practi is helping business owners to run their restaurants more efficiently.
