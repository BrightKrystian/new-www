## About HS Baumappe

HS Baumappe are **offline-first iOS and Android native applications** built for German company **Heinrich Schmid**, representing the construction sector. 

Mobile applications have been developed for clients’ employees who work on construction sites. The apps enable the creation and sharing of documents among the construction crew with clients and external contractors.

## The goal of the solution

The ultimate goal of the solution is to **manage the whole construction documentation via smartphone or tablet and eliminate paper documentation**.

## The challenge of building the document management app for construction

Construction sites are places where the internet connection is weak or simply doesn’t exist. Therefore from the beginning, the priority was to build the offline-first application. It needed plenty of preparations during the requirement phase to determine when and how the apps should operate depending on the quality of the internet connection.

Developing offline mode is always an interesting technological challenge. However, this is a feature that we successfully delivered for our other clients (check [vCare](/projects/vCare) case study). Thanks to an offline mode users can create any document without an internet connection and the app will store the data on the user’s device. All files will be synchronized when the internet connection is back.
