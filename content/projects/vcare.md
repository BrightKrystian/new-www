<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="problem: patients put at risk due to inefficient medicine distribution" titleIcon="/images/three_flags.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

**In the United Kingdom, approximately [17,100 care homes are dedicated to accommodating over 400,000 individuals](https://www.braemarfinance.co.uk/s/insights/blog/facts-figures-uk-care-home-sector-MCXEQ2ZU7QKVFOBOP272VSXJDDWQ#:~:text=The%20care%20home%20sector%20in,after%20more%20than%20400%2C000%20people.)**. The UK's care home sector plays a pivotal role in supporting those in need of professional care.

In the extensive array of duties borne by care home providers, the task of **medicine distribution is a crucial and demanding responsibility**. The lack of digitalization in this area has cast a long shadow, leading to a confronting reality where **communication between pharmacies and care homes is fragmented and historical data on patient medication distribution alarmingly inaccessible**. 

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="solution: a system that helps control medicine distribution" titleIcon="/images/goal_title_section.png" titleIconAlt="solution" />

**[Camascope](https://www.camascope.com/), formerly VCare Systems, a UK-based health tech company**, was co-founded by **[Saurabh Shah](https://blog.camascope.com/resources/post/the-camascope-story), a pharmacist with 15+ years of experience** whose vision led to the creation of the Electronic **Medication Administration Record (eMAR)**, streamlining medicine distribution for care home professionals.



<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="process of developing vCare application" titleIcon="/images/gearwheel.svg" titleIconAlt="bright" />

Our design team’s goal was to create intuitive, reliable mobile apps that would make it easy to register medicine administration and view historical records for each patient. It was absolutely crucial that anyone using the app knew whether a given resident had already taken his/her medication, and had the option to add a note on the patient’s profile.

To further increase the security of home care residents, the software also needed to include a supervisor approval feature for any significant change in treatment applied by a member of staff.

Our designers worked on the redesign and incorporation of these and several other new features to the Android app, and designed the entire experience for iOS.

For updating the Android app, our developers worked in Kotlin, and applied Room library for the database, Dagger for dependency injection, and Coroutines for asynchronous programming.

For iOS, we chose to work in Swift, and – among others – applied Cocoa Pods for dependency injection, Nimble and Quick for running tests, and Teamcity and Fastlane for deployment.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="result" titleIcon="/images/results_icon_title_small.png" titleIconAlt="result" />

The iOS and updated Android apps were released in 2019. For three years after the launch, we actively supported the client in maintenance and delivered new features. We are happy to see how the product is growing. We are also grateful for the opportunity to support the client during the crucial period after the launch.
