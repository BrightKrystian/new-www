<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="problem – the technology doesn&#39;t fully support Relevo’s mission" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="problem" />

The year 2473 – by then, the plastic made today will probably have decomposed. Germany itself witnesses the consumption of approximately [3 million tons of plastic packaging yearly](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1265122/plastic-packaging-consumption-germany/). **Relevo, a Germany-based startup, introduced a pioneering solution: the provision of reusable containers for restaurants**, which could be borrowed by their customers free of charge. 

<div className="image">![Relevo app](../../static/images/relevo_official_material3.png "Relevo app")</div>

Relevo’s immense growth following the MVP launch was every startup founder's dream but it also presented some hurdles. As the app user base started to grow our client **needed an experienced tech partner to lead them through the further development providing a seamless Android and iOS mobile experience as well as transforming to new frameworks**.

The client sought a well-organized team ready to support them in scaling a best-in-class tableware reusable system that would be highly rated by the users.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="challenges: overcoming technical and cultural barriers " titleIcon="/images/two_flags.svg" titleIconAlt="challenges" />

Relevo and Bright Inventions’ priority has been to increase the scalability & reliability of the backend system. The challenge is to ensure the system stability during peak hours. The rapid growth of users for an app like Relevo happens during lunchtime when people use the app in restaurants. At the same time we were also developing and launching new features to provide the users with new capabilities continuously. 

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="main features developed by Bright Inventions" titleIcon="/images/icons_features_svg.svg" titleIconAlt="features" />

* Panel for restaurants,
* QR code scanning,
* Integration with online food delivery services,
* Payment system.

The founders of Relevo were looking for an experienced [software development company](/) that could take over the backend development. Bright Inventions was recommended by our long-term client – [EY etventure](https://www.etventure.com). The product was already launched and gained a steady number of users. However, the backend system needed to be quickly adjusted to the rapid growth of users looking to access the app. 

We are in the process of rewriting the whole backend using technologies such as Node.js, NestJS and AWS. Also, we take care of the frontend part – developing a panel for restaurants allowing for managing the app users’ activity as well as an admin panel. 

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="development process" titleIcon="/images/gearwheel.svg" titleIconAlt="development process" />

Although our team was hired to take care mainly of the backend side, we are about to take over the whole [mobile app development](/our-areas/mobile-app-development) as well. Our mobile developers will be working on both Android and iOS versions. We are extremely happy that the client trusted us to develop the whole system now. Our cooperation with Relevo started at the end of 2020 and in a couple of months this adventure quickly moved to another level.
