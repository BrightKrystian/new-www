## About TMS project

Our client – [MAKO TSL](https://makotsl.com/) hired Bright Inventions to **build a customized tool for their internal transport management department**. MAKO TSL offers fast and safe forwarding and transport services to companies all over Europe. 

The client has used various freight management solutions available on the market. Yet none of them met all their needs. So they hired us to build a **customized transport management system to be used by the client’s employees**.

## Main features developed by Bright Inventions

* **Importing freight listings** from popular transport marketplaces.
* **Filtering out listings** that don’t match the basic criteria (weight and size of the load, route details, etc.).
* **Preliminary matching** of the listings with the right vehicle and driver. Then it can be verified by the forwarder.
* **Managing the route** from arrival to the destination point. Adding extra points on the carriers’ map.
* Receiving **notifications from the drivers** about delays or other disturbances on the road.
