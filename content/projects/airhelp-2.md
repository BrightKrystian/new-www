description: AirHelp mobile application lets you check if your flight is
  eligible for compensation and guides you through the whole process of
  complaints. AirHelp has assisted more than 16 million passengers all over the
  world. We cooperated with the company in 2015. We rewrote the previous iOS
  application that was just leading to the web page right after completing a
  couple of steps to a native technology.

## Goal

The main goal was to create a mobile-friendly tool for users that want to file a complaint about a delayed or canceled flight. The app had to be really simple and minimalistic so that users are able to quickly go with the flow even if they have to provide much detailed information about the flight.
