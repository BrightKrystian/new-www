## **Mobile apps that were a part of the restaurant & retail systems:**

* ePOS iOS and Android applications used by restaurant staff to take orders and manage payments.
* iOS and Android driver application which assists drivers in delivering orders.

## **Bright Inventions’ mobile stack and skills:**

**Android**: Kotlin, Coroutines, Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel, Room, Navigation, Paging), Firebase, Google Maps, Dagger 2, Robolectric and other Google APIs

**iOS**: Realm, ReactiveSwift, PureLayout, MixPanel, Alamofire, Fastlane, Firebase

## iOS development

iOS products developed by our team are used in restaurants in Israel. Practi iOS solution is one of the top ePOS solutions used by restaurants in Israel. There are three main retail products developed by bright iOS developers.

### **Reggie iOS ePOS application**

Reggie is “the mind” of the whole ePOS system at the restaurant. It is a cash register itself. It’s fully integrated with JustEat and a couple of others online food delivery companies. You can manage orders from clients in the restaurant as well as take care of all phone and internet orders. Also, the app enables you to manage drivers if your restaurant hires them.

### **Click & Collect – iOS white label application**

The app is dedicated to restaurants which want to offer clients their own meal ordering application. “White label app” is the product that can be easly adjusted to clients brand visual identity and business needs. Therefore every restaurant can use this app but it looks differently for every business. The app allows restaurant’s customers to order items from menu and get them delivered or collected on their own.

### **Driver app** 

Our team has also developed an independent product used by drivers who deliver the orders from a restaurant to customers. The app not only shows the destination and navigates drivers but also keeps them informed about the transaction details. Drivers know whether the order was paid or it needs to be paid. The driver is well-aware about the payment method (by cash or card). Thanks to the app, drivers are provided with all necessary information and can focus on delivering the meals as soon as possible.

## **Android development**

Android development team delivers similar solutions to the iOS team. Android app is used by end-users in the UK and soon will be launched in other European countries.

### Reggie Android ePOS application

The app lets you manage food orders made at restaurant, by phone or the website.

Some of the features of the Android Just Eat POS application are:

* Catalog – the main screen of the app used to quickly set up orders taken at place (in person). The cashier or other stuff member has access to all menu items and can choose the ones a client wants to order. They can also choose the delivery option if needed and enter client’s data. Then a cashier can proceed to the transaction.
* Customer Orders – the dashboard displaying all orders made externally – via a phone or online food delivery providers like Takeaway, Just Eat, etc. So these are orders that weren't made in person. The app user can quickly check the status of every order and assign a driver to deliver it to the customer.
* Reports – the app displays various data and statistics that shows your company revenue, number of orders and sold items, details about the inventory and more.
* Printing receipt – the app enables to print payment receipts as well as receipts printed in the kitchen with details about the order.
* Integration with CallerID – when a client calls, the application assigns the caller number with the order.

## Delivering customized applications for Bluetooth devices

A great part of working with Just Eat POS is building iOS and Android applications integrated with Bluetooth retail and ePOS devices including:

* POS Desktops,
* Payment terminals,
* Magnetic stripe readers,
* Label and thermal printers, 
* Caller ID hardware, 
* Kitchen Display Systems,
* Electronic scales,
* Barcode scanners,
* Kiosks.
