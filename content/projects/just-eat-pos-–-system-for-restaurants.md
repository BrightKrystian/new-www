## Main products developed for Just Eat POS:

Just Eat POS system took care of the whole process of managing restaurant orders: from ordering the meal, providing kitchen staff with details to delivering the order to the client’s table or home. It also supported daily running of the restaurant by managing employees time, creating menus or providing tools to build their own restaurant website.

## The system was built around these products:

* ePOS iOS and Android applications used by restaurant staff to take orders and manage payments.
* White label application for restaurants to take orders via their own, dedicated website.
* iOS and Android driver application which assists drivers in delivering orders.
* Website which enables to display restaurant’s menu and offers integrations with online delivery providers like JET or Wolt.
* Backoffice solutions including managing integrations and API connections.
