## About Just Eat POS and Bright Inventions cooperation

The client reached out to us in **2013**. At that time it was an early-stage Israeli startup that offered “Practi” web application solutions to users. Since 2013 **the company has transformed from a promising startup to an international ePOS applications provider**.

In 2019 Practi was **acquired by Just Eat Takeaway**. **Bright Inventions has had a great opportunity to assist the client** during this incredible ride, including the whole business transformation.

##  Client’s expectations

The client expects us to actively take part in creating the whole system. We are not only “code suppliers”, **we are technical partners offering years of software development experience**. Our mobile and web knowledge, and the fact that we have been working on this system since 2013 enables us to evaluate technical and business decisions. As a result, when needed, we gladly offer alternative solutions that would benefit the client and end-users.

## Challenges and goals

Just Eat POS system is a product with over 10 years of history. It was built as a startup solution for a small group of clients with specific needs. Now the system is a part of the Just Eat Takeaway's family. 

Therefore **scalability is the key now**. Our teams are in the process of rebuilding some applications to make them more accessible for a growing number of users.

The increasing number of users also means that **Bright Inventions’s team has to actively monitor services, especially metrics such as CPU usage, number of database connections and average response time**. The goal is to predict and solve any potential issues before they could affect clients.
