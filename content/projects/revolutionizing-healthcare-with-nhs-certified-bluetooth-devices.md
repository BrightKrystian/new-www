title: Revolutionizing Healthcare with NHS-Certified Bluetooth Devices
image: /images/case-study_cover_remote_monitoring.png
description: The future of healthcare lies in remote medical care. With the
  system we had the privilege to develop for Camascope, that future is already a
  reality. Physicians can remotely monitor patients' conditions, and if their
  vital signs become alarming, the algorithm will trigger an alert, recommending
  the initiation of emergency procedures.

Healthcare systems worldwide face unprecedented challenges, highlighted by the strains of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the United Kingdom has grappled with staffing shortages, with [NHS workforce data](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/staff-shortages-in-the-nhs-and-social-care-sectors/#heading-1) revealing an increase in overall and nursing vacancies despite a slight increase in medical positions.

In parallel, a surge in patients grappling with chronic illnesses and mental health concerns poses a pressing concern. The WHO reports that depression affects [264 million people globally,](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders) while [6 out of 10 U.S. adults suffer from chronic conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm). Conventional healthcare services struggle to meet this growing demand, emphasizing the pivotal role of digitalization in offering effective solutions.
