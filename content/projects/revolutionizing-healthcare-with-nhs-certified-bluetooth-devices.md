title: Revolutionizing Healthcare with NHS-Certified Bluetooth Devices
image: /images/case-study_cover_remote_monitoring.png
description: The future of healthcare lies in remote medical care. With the
  system we had the privilege to develop for Camascope, that future is already a
  reality. Physicians can remotely monitor patients' conditions, and if their
  vital signs become alarming, the algorithm will trigger an alert, recommending
  the initiation of emergency procedures.
