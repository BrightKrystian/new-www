title: Transforming Healthcare with NHS-Certified Bluetooth Devices
image: /images/case-study_cover_remote_monitoring.png
description: The future of healthcare lies in remote medical care. With the
  system we had the privilege to develop for Camascope, that future is already a
  reality. Physicians can remotely monitor patients' conditions, and if their
  vital signs become alarming, the algorithm will trigger an alert, recommending
  the initiation of emergency procedures.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="unlocking digital health: addressing staff shortages &amp;amp; rising health challenge" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_about.svg" titleIconAlt="unlocking digital health: addressing staff shortages & rising health challenge" />

Healthcare systems worldwide face unprecedented challenges, highlighted by the strains of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the United Kingdom has grappled with staffing shortages, with [NHS workforce data](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/staff-shortages-in-the-nhs-and-social-care-sectors/#heading-1) revealing an increase in overall and nursing vacancies despite a slight increase in medical positions.

In parallel, a surge in patients grappling with chronic illnesses and mental health concerns poses a pressing concern. The WHO reports that depression affects [264 million people globally,](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders) while [6 out of 10 U.S. adults suffer from chronic conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm). Conventional healthcare services struggle to meet this growing demand, emphasizing the pivotal role of digitalization in offering effective solutions.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="empowering healthcare transformation: Camascope&amp;#39;s RPM &amp;amp; telemedicine revolution" titleIcon="/images/icon_title_goal.svg" titleIconAlt="empowering healthcare transformation: Camascope's RPM & telemedicine revolution" />

**[Camascope](https://www.camascope.com/), formerly known as VCare, is a pioneering British health tech company** that has fully embraced the potential of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and telemedicine. **Their collaboration with Bright Inventions has already yielded a robust Medicine Administration Record (eMAR) system**, available on both Android and iOS platforms. This eMAR system effectively connects pharmacies with care homes, facilitating the secure, efficient, and compliant distribution of medication.

**Camascope has set us a new challenge: the development of a pilot RPM system for the Android platform**. This groundbreaking system allows for the remote monitoring of patients' vital signs, enabling physicians to oversee their patients' health remotely. This innovation not only revolutionizes post-discharge care, allowing patients to leave the hospital earlier while still receiving continuous medical attention but also optimizes daily care in numerous care homes throughout the United Kingdom.

**The RPM system is centered around an Android application, complemented by a couple of Bluetooth health-monitoring devices expertly integrated by the Bright Inventions team**. These devices empower medical professionals to efficiently manage more patients without the need for individual, time-consuming examinations. They continuously monitor patients' conditions, with the application seamlessly handling data analysis. In the end, the physician can initiate treatment based on the insights provided by the algorithm that drives this healthcare application.

<TitleWithIcon sectionTitle="the challenge of integrating multiple Bluetooth devices into a single system" titleIcon="/images/two_flags.svg" titleIconAlt="the challenge" />

Our team faced the formidable challenge of integrating various devices with distinct Software Development Kits (SDKs) into a cohesive system. With our Android team's expertise, we successfully harmonized these disparate SDKs into a unified system. Additionally, the team developed an algorithm capable of swiftly detecting whether a patient's vital signs indicate an immediate need for assistance. The data is transmitted to the doctor, and an alert is generated, suggesting that the patient considers calling an ambulance.
