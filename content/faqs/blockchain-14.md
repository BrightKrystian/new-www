question: What is Proof of Authority?
answer: It is the situation when **the identity of a person or organisation
  itself is a guarantee for other blockchain users**. In Proof of Authority,
  there is no payment for adding a block. Due to the fact that the authority
  behind that chain is well known in the chain, they can adjust blockchain to
  their needs. Algorithm Aura is an implementation of Proof of Authority.
