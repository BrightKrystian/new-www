question: What does the recruitment interview look like?
answer: >-
  At the interview, you will meet with recruiters and a software developer. 


  Naturally, if you apply for a non-developer position, then you will meet with another bright representative according to your job profession e.g. a product designer or a project manager.


  The interview usually **lasts about 2,5 hours**.


  **The interview at Bright Inventions contains a few stages:**


  * In the beginning, there is a short intro followed by a warmup, during which a candidate says a little about themselves. That part takes up to 10 minutes. 

  * Then, we have a technical part of the interview which can last up to 90 minutes. 

  * At the end, there is a non-technical part which helps to know better candidatesâ€™ experience and soft skills. It is also helpful to establish a cultural fit. Moreover, it is an opportunity to talk in English to verify foreign language knowledge.
