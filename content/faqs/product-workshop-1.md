question: What is a product workshop?
answer: Product workshop (also called product design workshop) is a way to move
  further on the product development process. It works perfectly for startups
  that only have an idea for a product. Also, it is a great workshop for
  businesses that have developed a more mature product but donâ€™t have a clue how
  to improve it. In the end product workshop ensures that design team vision
  meets clients expectations. However, it is more than that. It is not only
  about the design but also the whole business potential of the software
  solution. Product workshops help to establish target groups. They evaluate the
  software idea and sometimes even help to pivot it.
