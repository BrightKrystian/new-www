question: What are IoT development services?
answer: >-
  These are all services and expertise that an IoT development company brings.
  An IoT agency should take care of every aspect of software development,
  depending on your product's stage. If you are in the ideation phase, the IoT
  company's role is to evaluate the idea. Then they design the product, build a
  secure solution and take care of the maintenance after the launch.


  Naturally, you can choose to work on some aspects internally. For example, you can have your own design team that will provide UI and UX design.
