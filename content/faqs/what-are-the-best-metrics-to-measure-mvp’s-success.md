question: What are the best metrics to measure MVP’s success?
answer: >-
  There are various metrics that a company can measure to determine if its MVP
  is a success. They should be established during the ideation phase of MVP
  development so at the very beginning of the MVP building process. However,
  they can change while MVP building continues when you start to better
  understand the MVP domain. It might be smart to adjust some metrics to the
  industry your MVP tries to enter.


  **Here are some of the most common metrics to measure the success of MVP:**


  * **App download rate**: a crucial metric for mobile MVPs, showing how appealing the app is to users and if marketing is effective. 

  * **User engagement**: This metric measures how actively users are engaging with your MVP. It could be measured through metrics such as daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), time spent on the app, or retention rates.

  * **Conversion rate**: This metric measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action such as signing up, making a purchase, or filling out a form. It is a crucial metric as it directly impacts the revenue generated by your MVP.

  * **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)**: This metric measures the cost of acquiring a single customer. It is calculated by dividing the total cost of sales and marketing efforts by the number of new customers acquired during the same period. A low CAC is desirable, as it indicates that the startup is acquiring customers at an affordable cost.

  * **Churn rate**: This metric measures the percentage of users who stop using your product over a given period. It is a critical metric as it helps you identify potential issues with your MVP that might be causing users to churn.

  * **Customer lifetime value (CLV)**: This metric measures the total revenue generated by a customer over their entire lifetime. It is calculated by multiplying the average value of purchase by the number of purchases made by the customer in a year, and then multiplying that number by the average length of time that a customer remains active.
