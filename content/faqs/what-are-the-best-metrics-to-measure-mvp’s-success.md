question: What are the best metrics to measure MVP’s success?
answer: There are various metrics that a company can measure to determine if its
  MVP is a success. They should be established during the ideation phase of MVP
  development so at the very beginning of the MVP building process. However,
  they can change while building continues when you start to better understand
  the MVP domain. It might be smart to adjust some metrics to the industry your
  MVP tries to enter.
