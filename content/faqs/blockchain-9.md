question: Where blockchain can be used?
answer: >-
  There are many ways how blockchain can be used for. Let us present a few
  examples.


  Blockchain is obviously well-known for **supporting payment transactions** without engaging third parties e.g. banks. That is why this technology is used to **build various cryptocurrencies**. 


  Apart from that, blockchain is a great technology to **safely and transparently store data**. Thanks to that, blockchain can directly help to **protect copyrights for music, movies and other content** that is illegally distributed on the internet. Blockchain may protect this data and assign copyrights to their authors to enable them to get credit for their work. 


  Blockchain is used in the **banking sector to transparently store and present public documents**. Thanks to blockchain clients can see the actual version of the documents such as: terms and conditions for an account or the fee information for a credit card. Clients can see the actual version of the document and even quickly verify if the document is authentic. Blockchain ensures that presented data will be authentic because there is no chance to temper with them.
