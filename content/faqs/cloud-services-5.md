question: Are cloud services secure?
answer: Cloud services give you all the possible tools and other resources like
  documentation to develop secured cloud architecture. However, as in many
  cases, most depend on people who use these tools. Developers and DevOps get
  tools to secure their services. But it depends on them if they implement them
  correctly. Technology is helpful, but the rest is still up to developers and
  DevOps.
