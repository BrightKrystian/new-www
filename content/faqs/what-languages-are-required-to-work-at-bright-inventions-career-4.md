question: What languages are required to work at Bright Inventions?
answer: >-
  We look for candidates who are **fluent in Polish and English**. You don't
  have to be a native Polish speaker. Yet since we are a software development
  company based in Poland, knowing the Polish language is necessary to
  communicate internally.


  Most of our clients are outside of Poland, so we also expect candidates to be fluent in English to be able to communicate with clients.
