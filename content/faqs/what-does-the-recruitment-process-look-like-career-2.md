question: What does the recruitment process look like?
answer: >-
  Typical steps in Bright Inventionsâ€™ recruitment process are:


  1. You send your CV or LinkedIn profile and we screen it.

  2. When your expertise matches our must-have requirements (which are always listed in our job offers), we invite you to an interview (including technical & non-technical parts). The interview will be conducted by a member of our recruitment team and a tech recruiter.

  3. After the interview, you will be asked to work on a task showing your practical skills. In some cases, we go with a different order. So, donâ€™t be surprised if the task is sent to you before your interview. 

  4. Then we perform a task review. Afterward, itâ€™s time for skills evaluation and feedback.

  5. If both sides are on the same page, you will become a bright team member. Welcome! ðŸ™‚
