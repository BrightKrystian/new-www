question: What is the mobile app development process?
answer: A typical mobile development process contains a few steps, however, the
  final flow depends on what stage the project is at. Clients often come to us
  with the **idea for an app** and need help to verify its business potential.
  In that case, we offer **app prototyping** that helps to visualize their idea
  and understand the usersâ€™ needs and market potential. After that, we are ready
  to [build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)](/our-areas/mvp-development). When
  MVP is ready, there is time for **app development & maintenance** which is the
  final step of the app development process.
