question: What is the mobile app development process?
answer: A typical mobile development process contains a few steps, however, the
  final flow depends on what stage the project is. Clients often come to us with
  the **idea for an app** and need help to verify its business potential. In
  that case, we offer **app prototyping** that helps to visualize their idea and
  understand the usersâ€™ needs and market potential. After that, we are ready to
  build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). When MVP is ready, there is time for
  **app development & maintenance** which is the final step of the app
  development process.
