question: What is the mobile app development timeline?
answer: The final software development timeline depends on the project and its
  requirements. In case a client expects only a prototype version of their idea,
  we usually **create a prototype during a 1 to 4 weeks period**. If a client
  wants to [build an MVP](/our-areas/mvp-development), **we might develop MVPs
  in 4 to 20 weeks**. The final step â€“ **developing and maintenance of the
  launched product** is the job that once the app succeeds **is never over**.
