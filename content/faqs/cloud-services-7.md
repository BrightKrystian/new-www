answer: >-
  They can be used by a variety of businesses represented by **startups as well
  as larger organizations**. 


  Cloud services give **startups** a chance for a quick launch which might be crucial when you develop MVP (Minimum Viable Product). You can easily launch your business using ready solutions provided by AWS or Azure. It helps to quickly launch your online business and verify its potential. If your project turns out well, then you can start working on your cloud services optimization and scalability.


  If you represent a **larger organization** then the cloud gives you options to optimize your service. Firstly, you can optimize the speed of your applications. You can optimize your service in a way that people from different places in the world would have a similar user experience. Also, you can have your data replicated between different localisations so you no longer worry about what will happen when one from offline localisations is down. Also, you can outsource some of your workloads to the cloud and you donâ€™t have to worry about maintenance.
