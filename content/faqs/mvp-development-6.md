question: What are MVP software development examples?
answer: There are lots of famous software solutions that were launched as
  minimum viable products. Perfect MVP examples are **Facebook, Groupon,
  Airbnb** or **Uber**. All of these well-known platforms were launched with a
  small range of features to test if thereâ€™s a market for these services. Thanks
  to MVP development founders of Facebook or Uber could launch products fast and
  at little cost and then develop the product following users feedback.
