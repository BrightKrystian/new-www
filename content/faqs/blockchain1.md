question: How does blockchain technology work?
answer: >-
  **Blockchain can be defined as a decentralised chain of blocks that are
  connected to each other by use of cryptography.** Data at the blockchain is
  decentralised and secured because it is stored at every machine that is part
  of the network. Thus everyone has the same access to data and no third party
  can control or modify it.   


  Every block in the chain has a unique cryptographic hash that is based on the hash of the previous block and data that it contains so they create an inseparable chain. As major of the network consensus is needed to change the chain **tempering with blockchain data is practically impossible because they are linked with mathematical code that cannot be changed without affecting the whole chain**.  


  Blockchain is known mostly as a technology that enables building cryptocurrency. However, it offers a wide range of functionalities. Blockchain supports fintech, healthcare, real estate and other industries. It is no longer only about creating various cryptocurrencies.
