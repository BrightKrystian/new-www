question: Are cloud services expensive?
answer: >-
  The costs of using cloud providers like AWS or Azure depend on what features
  you choose to use. So it gives flexibility – you can freely decide what you
  want your provider to take care of and what you will do on your own to save
  some costs. So cloud providers, thanks to this type of business model, give an
  opportunity to save businesses money. You can always set up budget limits and
  alerts to stay on top of things and be aware of how much some features will
  cost your business.


  Also, cloud migration can change the types of costs for a business, therefore, making it more affordable. For example, you don’t pay for infrastructure and experts to maintain it, you just pay for the service which includes maintaining your infrastructure. In simple terms, you can outsource it and save some money.
