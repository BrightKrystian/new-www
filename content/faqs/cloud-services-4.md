question: Do cloud computing and cloud services are the same?
answer: Cloud services is a general term. Practically every site and service
  hosted in a cloud is a part of cloud services. **Cloud computing is a part of
  cloud services**. Yet it does not mean that every solution in the cloud
  matches cloud computing. For example, you can have a website aggregating
  pictures and it is stored in a cloud. Does it mean that it is cloud computing?
  Not really.
