question: How often do you update the open positions on your website?
answer: >-
  We display job offers only when we really need to hire new team members. Some
  of our job offers are “ongoing” for a couple of months which means that we are
  in the process of filling a couple of vacancies. 


  We also publish offers with an “opening soon” status which means that we will be looking for new team members for that position in the next few weeks. All job offer statuses are displayed on the [Career](/career) page.
