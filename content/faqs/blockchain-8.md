question: What are the blockchain development process steps?
answer: >-
  Typical blockchain development is pretty similar to building a regular
  software product. A flow contains ideation, prototyping of client’s vision,
  developing MVP and launching the product which is followed by constant
  development and maintenance. If you want to better understand the software
  development process, click to know details about every [software development
  step](/blog/what-are-the-stages-of-app-development/).


  **In Ethereum blockchain the first stages: prototyping and [MVP development](/our-areas/mvp-development) are crucial.** Why? Because that’s the moment when you establish a smart contract. In Ethereum you have to really think through the conditions of your smart contract because if you decide to change it in the future you won’t be able to carry on with the present smart contract. You would have to migrate it.
