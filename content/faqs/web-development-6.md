question: Why web development is important for business?
answer: Web development helps businesses in many ways. First of all, by building
  a company web page we develop the basic medium for our brandâ€™s marketing
  activity. Second of all, you might need a web app for your business to use
  internally by your employees. Web apps needed by medium-sized and larger
  businesses are usually software that helps to automate internal processes in
  departments like customer service or human resources.
