question: How do IoT devices communicate?
answer: Devices can communicate with each other via Bluetooth or through the
  internet using some lightweight communication protocol like MQTT. Devices
  subscribe to MQTT topics and receive messages from the broker. A broker could
  be a self-hosted service like Mosquitto, VerneMQ or HiveMQ, or it could be a
  cloud service from an IoT platform provider like AWS IoT, Azure IoT or Google
  Cloud IoT Core.
