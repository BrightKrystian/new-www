question: What are the steps in product design?
answer: >-
  Every product design flow is unique because it follows project needs. The
  typical product design steps are:


  * **Research** – deep analysis of the industry, business goals, needs of clients, and end-users (sometimes these groups are different).

  * **Product workshops** – establishing a path to develop the idea or product that will lead them to reach their business goals and meet their users’ needs.

  * **Mockups phase** – a phase that enables to see the draft of the user interface.

  * **Prototype phase** – the step when you can easily test your new version of the user flow. It shows the direction for the development phase.

  * **Designing the whole system** – the moment when all the work finds its results in the final design that can be implemented by developers.
