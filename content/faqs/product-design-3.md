question: How important is product design?
answer: Product design is an integral part of every software development
  process. It quickly validates the idea for the product, helps to evolve with
  it, and changes it into something that users want to use and purchase. It
  simply turns an idea into a fully functioning product helping in advance to
  eliminate costly mistakes and bumps on the road.
