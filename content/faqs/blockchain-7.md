question: What is Parity Substrate blockchain?
answer: >-
  Substrate is the open-source blockchain that was created to build a future
  decentralised web. The Substrate is the parity’s blockchain framework that
  helps to build projects by the Parity community. 


  The idea behind Parity Substrate is groundbreaking. **The Parity community works on building the internet where all users will be the owners of their identity and won’t be dependent on tech giants that nowadays store our data.** From the software development perspective, Substrate has interesting advantages compared to Ethereum. Ethereum requires using smart contracts to build other blocks. Substrate enables to customise the whole business logic for clients needs. You can create your own consensus, proof of work and other crucial parts of your blockchain system. At Bright Inventions, we are particularly interested in Substrate and support the community by developing the [Bright Treasury application](/projects/bright-treasury/) that helps blockchain developers get funds for their Substrate projects.
