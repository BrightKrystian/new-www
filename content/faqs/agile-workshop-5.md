question: Can Agile be used for non-software projects?
answer: Yes! Although we have been using Agile for software development, we
  believe that this methodology will perfectly suit organisations from other,
  even non-technical, industries. Agile is about communication and collaboration
  which are crucial in every work environment. It is all about flexibility and
  adaptability to your needs. We can show you how to implement Agile project
  management in your team.
