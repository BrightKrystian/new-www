question: What is MVP in Agile development?
answer: >-
  Building MVP is in close relation to Agile methodology. Why? Because it is a
  nimble approach helping to **build products fast to quickly confront it with
  users**.


  Agile is an **opposite approach to the waterfall model** in which the goal is to launch more advanced products. The waterfall is a linear process and Agile is all about iterations, developing features in cycles step by step. At Bright Inventions we follow Agile methodology because we believe that the nimble approach helps to develop a better product that meets users needs. Also, Agile teams are more flexible and easily react to changes that in software development happen practically every day.
