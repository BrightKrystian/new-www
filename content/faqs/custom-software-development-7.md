question: What is the difference between generic software product and custom
  software development?
answer: >-
  Generic software is a universal solution that can be adjusted to users needs
  (with some compromises). Custom software development is usually built from the
  very beginning as a reflection of the client’s expectations. For example, when
  you enter the e-commerce world, there is a range of generic solutions like
  Shopify or Shoplo to choose from. However, if your idea for e-commerce can’t
  be supported with these platforms, then the better option is to build your own
  custom software.


  General and custom solutions both have sense, yet still in different circumstances. For example, it might seem pointless to develop an internal calculating solution for your company when you can easily use well-known Microsoft Excel that probably will meet your expectations. On the contrary, when you want to build a product dedicated to a very specific target group – let’s say, for asthmatics, then it would be challenging to find a generic solution that will fit in the daily life of patients suffering from this chronic disease.
