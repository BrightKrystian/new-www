question: What is a product discovery workshop?
answer: It is a crucial step of the development process of your product (also
  known as a product development workshop). It is dedicated to businesses that
  have an idea for a product but donâ€™t know what their next moves should be.
  During product discovery workshops you will set up goals, target groups,
  challenges and strengths of your idea. During the design brainstorming we will
  mix all participants' experiences, perspectives and views to establish a
  specific path on how to successfully develop and launch your software product.
