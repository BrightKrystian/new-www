question: What is a product flow workshop?
answer: A product workshop is perfect for businesses that know how their idea
  should work and look like but they need to build a system around that. In that
  case, our job is to map with you user journeys and create a flow of your
  product. We will establish what features should be considered for your
  [Minimum Viable Product](/our-areas/mvp-development) (MVP). In the end, we can
  create mockups of your product that ensure you that all your requirements are
  met.
