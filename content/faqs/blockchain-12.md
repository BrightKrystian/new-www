question: What is Proof of Work?
answer: It is a popular blockchain consensus in Ethereum. **Building a block is
  possible when you find a cryptography solution. We may say that you have to
  solve a mathematical puzzle. You have to find the right number that is added
  to the header of the block.** Of course, it involves lots of mathematic work
  which is done by computers around the world. In Ethereum the number is found
  by a dedicated algorithm Ethash. Proof of Work demands using high computer
  power from many GPU processors. In case of Ethereum, building a block results
  in a reward for a miner in Ether.
