question: What are IoT applications?
answer: IoT applications enable the communication and the exchange of
  information among different devices that are a part of the IoT network. For
  example, an app connected to a Bluetooth thermometer gathers and analyses the
  data about a patient’s temperature then passes it on to the doctor’s devices,
  for example, tablets or computers.
