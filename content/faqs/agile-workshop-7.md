question: Is your Agile course suited for scrum masters?
answer: It is not a typical scrum master certification course. Our workshops
  give a chance to go beyond theory and turn knowledge into practice. Of course,
  we can help a scrum master to prepare for the certified exam. Also, we can
  meet with scrum masters that have passed the official exam but are still eager
  to learn more about practical approaches to Agile development. Our workshop
  for scrum masters is about sharing teachable experiences that we have from
  developing various software products with different teams.
