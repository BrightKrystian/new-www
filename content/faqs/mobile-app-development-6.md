question: What does a native app mean?
answer: "**Native app development stands for building the app directly in the
  technology provided by the operating system creator (Apple, Google)** with no
  additional layers in between (like Flutter or React Native). We have
  experience from multiple projects in both approaches, in which we have learned
  that native app development (Swift, Kotlin) is the only reliable way to
  deliver the premium app quality and the best user experience."
