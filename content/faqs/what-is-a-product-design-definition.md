question: What is a product design definition?
answer: Product design can be described as **turning an idea for a software (or
  existing product) into a user-friendly solution, ensuring that it meets all
  business goals**. Product design is a multidisciplinary process that involves
  the participation of stakeholders, investors, product owners from the client
  side as well as product designers, frontend and [backend
  developers](/blog/6-things-you-should-know-about-backend-developers-from-poland),
  and Agile coaches representing a product design agency.
