question: What are the benefits of custom software development?
answer: >-
  * **Freedom**: no rules or limitations block your product development. If you
  are a startup, you decide which features must be included in MVP. Or what
  version of the product will ensure scalability for a more mature organization.
  You are not dependent on previous solutions because you are building a product
  that totally represents your business.

  * **Flexibility**: when the project from the start is being designed according to your needs, then it is easier to modify and evolve it.

  * **Building something unique**: with custom software development it is easier to build an innovative product that stands out from the competition.
