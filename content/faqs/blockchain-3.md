question: How much does blockchain development cost?
answer: The cost to develop a blockchain depends on the project that the
  software team is supposed to build. It is impossible to estimate the price
  without establishing the type of blockchain technology the client wants to
  use, what kind of features to build and the target groups that the project is
  built for. [Contact us](/start-project) and we will prepare the estimation
  according to your needs.
