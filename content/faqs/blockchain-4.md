question: What are blockchain benefits?
answer: >-
  * **Peer to peer (P2P) connection**: machines that are part of the network are
  connected in a way that there is no central server. So there is no risk of the
  main server going down. Also, hackers cannot simply attack the main server so
  the probability of a successful attack is pretty low.

  * **Decentralized data**: every machine can be a part of the network, have different localisation and store data.

  * **Open-source**: if a blockchain system is open-source (that’s not a must), your data aren’t dependent on any providers e.g. tech giants that store them on a daily basis.

  * **Transparency**: as a part of a blockchain network you can see information about every transaction or state change.

  * **Security**: decentralisation, encrypted data, P2P just make a blockchain more secure (difficult to hack).
