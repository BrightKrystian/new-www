question: What does IoT mean?
answer: IoT stands for the Internet of Things. IoT can be described as a network
  of devices, sensors and software that are all connected. Thanks to the IoT,
  well-known devices are “reborn” and get lots of new features. A great example
  is the modern Bluetooth thermometer. It used to be a device that measures
  temperature. Now it also sends data about temperature to the doctor or another
  care provider which enables managing patients’ conditions remotely. It all
  happens thanks to the dedicated apps that work with the devices.
