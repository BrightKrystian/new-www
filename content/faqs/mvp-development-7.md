question: Why should you launch MVP rather than a fully-fledged product?
answer: >-
  There are many benefits of a MVP:


  * You reduce costs by building only crucial features.

  * MVP lets you validate your assumptions about the target audience in a timely and low-cost manner.

  * Developing MVPs helps quickly enter the market and stay ahead of the competition.

  * Even if your MVP doesn’t succeed you won’t lose a significant investment because it is a low-cost solution. 

  * Also, your MVP might be a base for a pivot. It’s easier to change MVP into a different product rather than a fully-fledged, complex solution.
