question: How do you evaluate a candidate? Will I receive feedback from you?
answer: >-
  We look at a candidate holistically, ensuring that they have the required
  knowledge, experience, advanced soft skills, and a similar mindset. 


  Naturally, the candidate review is mainly dependent on the technical and non-technical interview and the quality of the task that has to be done by a candidate. **Soft skills are as important as technical knowledge** to us.


  Our recruitment team’s goal is to simply ensure that both sides are on the same page and want to cooperate.


  [Feedback](/blog/no-time-for-bullshit-feedback-culture/) is a very powerful tool that we use every day at Bright Inventions. That is why **every candidate receives feedback from us at the end of the recruitment process**. We indicate all strong and weak spots detected during the recruitment process. Also, we include recommendations on how to improve a candidate’s performance.
