question: Do you work with international clients?
answer: >-
  Most of our clients are located outside of Poland, yet they stay in similar
  time zones. We mostly work with clients from Europe, e.g. Germany, the UK, and
  Sweden. Also, we cooperate with clients from other continents. A few of them
  are located in Israel which is in GMT +2 time zone. So there is only a 1-hour
  difference between Poland and Israel.
