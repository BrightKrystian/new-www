His artistic soul wanted him to become a musician and photographer but brain directed him into IT. Compromise decided that he became iOS developer and made himself familiar with product design processes. But it wasn't the end - he's been spotted doing Scrum Master stuff and competing with UI designers in time of delivering assets.\

Beside IT you can find him making photos for personal brands and operating a drone aircraft. Keep your eyes in the air!\
