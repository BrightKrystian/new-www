Mostly self-taught Android Developer. He studied civil engineering but decided to drop out of his studies because he didn't want to sit by the desk in his job all day, and that's why he decided to become Mobile Developer. 



He graduated from Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sport. He worked as an acrobat and he even was a sport gymnastic and acrobatics coach for a moment. After hours he loves to ride across the city on his electric unicycle.
