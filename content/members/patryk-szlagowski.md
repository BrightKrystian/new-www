Software developer, geek, problem solver. He started his developer's life in primary school with a huge help of his first IT teacher. If he didn't become a software developer, he would be a blacksmith, a doctor or an orthodontist. After hours petrolhead, tattoo addict and music lover. At Bright Inventions he works as a Senior Backend Developer in team which he likes to call „The Avengers” because everybody has some superpower there.
