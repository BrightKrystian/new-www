Started programming adventure at the age of 12 and since then he has been experimenting with different technologies. After some affair with PHP, HTML and CSS he devoted himself to JavaScript and React. Privately a great fan of Italian food, rock and gym. Patryk's inspiration are Arnold Schwarzenegger's words: "Vision is powerful". It inspires our actions and creates the energy that helps us make things in life happen.
