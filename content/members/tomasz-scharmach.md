Graduate of Informatics with specialization in networking at the Gdansk University of Technology. He started his career as a developer but then worked for a few years as a network specialist. Ultimately, his love for programming was too strong so he came back to software development. He enjoys challenges and problem-solving. After hours loves to play tennis and watch some football games (especially Premier League).
