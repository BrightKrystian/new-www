I wrote my first lines of code at the age of 12 (it was a website for my school). As I failed to be a successful break dancer and musician I decided to be a programmer as it allows me to create things. Therefore I finished Computer Science at the Warsaw University of Technology. I first saw Swift language at the university and I fell in love with it and decided to start a career as an iOS Developer.

If I’m not making my car shine bright like a diamond, probably I’m cooking or playing with my cats.
