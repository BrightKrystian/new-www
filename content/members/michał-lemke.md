He has an old-school Linux and on-premises background, that nowadays serves him as a fundament for modern cloud computing with DevOps and SRE principles in mind. He started his SysAdmin journey back in 2005 with an old laptop motherboard turned into a home lab server located in a drawer. Some think that DevOps people live in a basement, but Michał stands up to the stereotype and burns off his spare energy on triathlon disciplines. His wife hates him for his never-finished smart home projects lying around the house. Happy father of his cute little daughter.
