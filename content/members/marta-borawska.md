QA Specialist with experience in manual testing and business analysis. Studied Material Engineering and worked for 3 years as a Product Engineer. While working with developers on improving the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system she realised what she wanted to do and decided to change her career path. 

Now she is focused on developing herself in test automation and learning programming after hours. In her free time she loves to dance Salsa. What is more, she is a member of the Dance Avenue Performance Team. She loves to travel and spend holidays in high mountains. Tatras mountains are her top place in the world. In terms of her food preferences, Thai food has a special place in her heart. ðŸ˜‰
