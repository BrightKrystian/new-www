After a few years of experimenting in Java discovered his passion for Kotlin and Android development. Always seeking optimal solutions. Obsessed with networking and administration stuff. In his free time, he crushes his enemies in video games.

Speaker at tech conferences, always eager to share his Kotlin knowledge with others. You can see him on stage during events like [4developers](https://4developers.org.pl) or [Warsaw IT Days](https://warszawskiedniinformatyki.pl/en/).
