**Since the bounties were introduced by the Substrate-based community, there was a need to build an intuitive app that would make it easier to manage bounties from creating a reward to completing the bounty. That is one of the reasons why the BrightTreaury app was built. The first stage of development was funded by Web3 Foundation and now the app is 100% supported by Polkadot and Kusama Treasuries. Check out how to easily propose a bounty and contribute to the Kusama and Polkadot networks.**

## How do Bounties for Polkadot and Kusama Work

A bounty is a reward for completing some kind of task. It might be building a feature or fixing a bug. However, it does not have to be related to programming. It can be a video promoting the Treasury or a translation of a technical guide about Polkadot.js integrations.

Simply put – you have an idea for a task that would contribute to the community but you don't have the knowledge or resources to do it so you propose the bounty for this job.

## Bounty in Kusama and Polkadot – unique factors

Bounties in Substrate chains, Kusama and Polkadot, work differently than bounties you could see on different blockchain communities or generally in software development. 

* A bounty is a reward for a job that will contribute to the community.
* When you propose a bounty, the council decides if it is valuable to the community. If yes, then the bounty is approved.
* If you create the bounty, you have to pay the deposit (to avoid spam). If the bounty is approved, you will get it back.
* The council not only approves the bounty but also assigns a curator.
* The curator should be an expert in the field related to a bounty task. He or she takes care of the whole bounty development process and assesses if it is completed.
