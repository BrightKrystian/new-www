## From which technologies did you start your programming adventure?

I started to code in high school. My first language was C99, so you can see it was over a decade ago. ;) **I was learning in a quite old fashioned way. I got a book and tried to do every exercise from it on my computer.** 

Then I started to learn C# during my Computer Science studies at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology. Back then I started my first internship in a corporation which turned into a part-time job. That was my first serious job. I worked there for 18 months. 

In the meantime I was diving into iOS development, learning Objective-C. 

## Why did you start to learn iOS development?

It all started because I decided to participate in the AppCamp competition. Contestants had to create their own iOS app from scratch. I had to pitch an idea for a healthcare app in front of the jury. Then they chose the apps with the greatest business potential. My idea was included so I had a chance to build my first app and launch it on the App Store. That was quite a big deal for me.

**That was the first time when I really had a taste of mixing software development with business.** I had to come up with ideas, goals and the code obviously. The only help I had was from a graphic designer. 

As a finalist I got a Macbook, on which I developed and launched my healthcare app, which obviously sped up my iOS development learning process. And helped me to change my job and get where I am â€“ to Bright Inventions. ðŸ™‚

## So how was it to join a small company from an international corporation?

During my master studies my lecturer Tomasz Dziubich from the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology recommended me to Bright Inventions. And that is how I came to Bright. I was so silly back then. I came to Bright office and I was thinking that I was coming there to have a tour of the office. Obviously, when I came there I had a technical interview. Imagine my surprise. ;) I felt so not ready for it.

Nevertheless, I was offered a job. So **I came to Bright Inventions and left the corporate world behind**. All of my friends and family warned me not to do it. Everyone was telling me that I should stay where I was â€“ with a full-time contract offer at a steady company, with an established brand. Corporations have lots of advantages and stability is on top of them. I needed something different though and decided to take that risk.

It turned out that I got lucky. **I came to Bright as one of the first employees. Our team consisted of 5 people back then. I was learning there like crazy. I was bombarded with knowledge.** The company was small so [MichaÅ‚](/about-us/michal/) had time and opportunities to teach me a lot. I learned 10 times faster than at the previous job. What was awesome was the lack of processes and procedures. Nothing stopped me from doing my job. I liked that. I donâ€™t claim that the corporate world is bad. It works for tons of people. It has lots of advantages. It just wasnâ€™t for me.

## You are an iOS Developer who turned into Technical Leader & Project Manager. What made you move your career in that direction?

It came quite naturally. There wasnâ€™t any meeting that established my new role. **It was a natural outcome and effect of the company's growth.** I always liked to take responsibility and initiative. **So when we started recruiting new people, there was a natural need for a leader to be established. Someone who knew the processes, company best practices and was not afraid to lead the way.**
