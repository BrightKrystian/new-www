## You are a backend developer. Yet I know that you wanted to be a mobile dev. What happened? ðŸ˜€

While I was studying Computer Science **I had this vision that I would start my career as a mobile developer**. I thought it would be so great to build something that could be downloaded by millions. Obviously, that was just a vision, far away from reality. ðŸ˜‰

I was pursuing that dream and got an internship to build a mobile app. When I joined the company it turned out the mobile app was basically done. Yet they needed help with the backend. So **I started to work with Spring Boot and quite enjoyed that**. 

Now **I am glad I pursued the backend path instead of mobile**. Maintaining backward compatibility in mobile isnâ€™t appealing to me. The backend is more simple in that way. So Iâ€™ve never regretted how things turned out. I sometimes build mobile apps, but only for personal use.

## How did you land in Bright Inventions?

Iâ€™ve known the company since college. **I met [Piotr](/about-us/piotr/) from Bright Inventions at a job fair** at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology. Back then I was writing my master's thesis on serverless so I **decided to visit every companyâ€™s stand to ask if they worked with serverless**. **Bright Inventions was the only one that did**. Then I had a great conversation about it with Piotr and I could immediately see how knowledgeable and experienced he was.

Our paths crossed again a few years later. Back then, I was working at a company where I learned Java and Kotlin. **Kotlin was life-changing to me**. I loved it. Unfortunately, I started to get projects in Python. I felt I needed to find a place where I could continue my work with Kotlin. So, I finally joined Bright Inventions. I was eager to work with Piotr on the huge international ePOS project with Kotlin and AWS.
