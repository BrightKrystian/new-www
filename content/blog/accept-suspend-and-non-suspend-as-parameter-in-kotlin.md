**Kotlin as always comes with a smart and simple solution. ðŸ˜€ Check out this tip!**

Instead of creating two analogous functions just to be able to provide both suspend and regular functions as parameters, like so:

```kotlin
fun doSomethingBeforeAndAfter(
nonSuspendAction: () -> Unit
) {
  somethingBeforeAction()
  nonSuspendAction()
  somethingAfterAction()
}

suspend fun doSomethingBeforeAndAfterForSuspendableActions(
 suspendAction: suspend () -> Unit
) {
  somethingBeforeAction()
  suspendAction()
  somethingAfterAction()
}
```

If you can define your function as â€˜inlineâ€™, it will also make it accept both suspend and non-suspend functions as parameters:

```kotlin
inline fun doSomethingBeforeAndAfter(
 action: () -> Unit
) {
  somethingBeforeAction()
  action()
  somethingAfterAction()
}
```
