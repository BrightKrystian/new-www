## HealthTech will finally shake off the post-COVID-19 hurdle

While HealthTech was anticipated to flourish in the aftermath of COVID-19, it sadly became one of the most impacted sectors. Since 2021, this industry has witnessed a noticeable downturn, evident in the decline of stock values.

However, 2023 offered renewed optimism, marked by significant acquisitions that signal a promising outlook for 2024.

As stated in the [State of Health Tech 2023](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-health-tech-2023) report:

<blockquote><div>The health tech cohort gains during summer of 2022 and January 2023 were mainly driven by announcements of relatively large acquisitions in the health tech sector, including Amazon’s $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical, CVS Health’s $8 billion acquisition of Signify Health, and CVS Health’s $10.6 billion acquisition of Oak Street Health.</div></blockquote>

Despite the financial struggles faced by the HealthTech sector, the enduring results of COVID-19's digital transformation in healthcare could not be slowed down.
