**The year 2024 comes with a promise of significant growth for HealthTech, following a period of stagnation. This growth will likely be fueled by innovations brought by Generative AI, IoT, wearables, mental HealthTech, and more. What can we expect from the MedTech sector? Read our technology trends in healthcare for 2024.**

## HealthTech will finally shake off the post-COVID-19 hurdle

While HealthTech was anticipated to flourish in the aftermath of COVID-19, it sadly became one of the most impacted sectors. Since 2021, this industry has witnessed a noticeable downturn, evident in the decline of stock values.

However, 2023 offered renewed optimism, marked by significant acquisitions that signal a promising outlook for 2024.

As stated in the [State of Health Tech 2023](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-health-tech-2023) report:

<blockquote><div>The health tech cohort gains during summer of 2022 and January 2023 were mainly driven by announcements of relatively large acquisitions in the health tech sector, including Amazon’s $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical, CVS Health’s $8 billion acquisition of Signify Health, and CVS Health’s $10.6 billion acquisition of Oak Street Health.</div></blockquote>

Despite the financial struggles faced by the HealthTech sector, the enduring results of COVID-19's digital transformation in healthcare could not be slowed down. **The need for digitalization in healthcare has already been established within the industry and among patients, who feel empowered to use technology to manage their health daily.**

## Advanced implementations of Generative AI in healthcare

It’s impossible to discuss innovations in healthcare without including Generative AI. It is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content, such as text, images, or data, by learning from existing examples and patterns. **So, what Generative Al use cases in HealthTech are we most likely to see in 2024?**

### Medical Imaging - one of the healthcare areas quickly to be transformed by AI

Medical imaging is a method used to create images of the inside of the body for medical diagnosis and treatment. It includes techniques like X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and ultrasound.

**Generative AI models are used to enhance medical imaging, following:**

* **Generating high-resolution images** from low-resolution inputs and reconstructing 3D images from 2D scans,
* **Complete time-consuming work** like tracing tumors, tracing structures,
  measuring the amount of fat and muscle in the body,
* **Data augmentation**: generating synthetic medical data, including images, text, or patient records or training machine learning models, especially when real data is limited or privacy concerns exist.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: generating human-like text, making them useful for tasks like medical transcription, generating clinical notes, and assisting with healthcare documentation.
* **Radiology Report Generation**: AI-driven models can automatically generate radiology reports based on medical images, helping radiologists save time and maintain consistency in their reporting.

AI can assist in diagnosing a variety of diseases, including:

* **Cancer**: AI algorithms can analyze medical images like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to detect tumors and other cancerous growths.
  Diabetes: Through pattern recognition in patient data, AI can help identify early signs of diabetes.
* **Heart Disease**: AI can analyze ECG patterns to detect heart conditions such as arrhythmias as well as identify other crucial factors such as atherosclerosis.
* **Neurological Disorders**: AI can help in diagnosing conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease by analyzing patient data and brain imaging.
* **Skin Conditions**: AI-driven image analysis tools can aid in diagnosing skin cancers and other dermatological conditions.
* **Eye Diseases**: AI algorithms can analyze retinal scans to detect diseases like diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.
