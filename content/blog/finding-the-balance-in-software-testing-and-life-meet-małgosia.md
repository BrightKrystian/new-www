**Nearly 9 years ago, Małgosia decided to transition into QA engineering, long before it became a trend. Once she discovered her passion for automated testing, there was no turning back. Now, she thrives on tackling daily challenges, from balancing the right test coverage to building robust relationships with developers. Dive into Małgosia's career story to explore her journey!**

I think I was among the first people who tried switching to software development before it became popular. At that time (about 9 years ago), I didn't know any success stories of such a transition; in fact, I had only heard about failures. But I still wanted to give it a try. So, I committed fully to this new path — **I quit my job and dedicated my time to learning every day**. 

Initially, my goal was to become a software developer. After two months of intensive learning, I began job hunting. I even received a software developer job offer. However, during this period, **I started writing my first automated tests, and it completely captivated me**. **I found immense enjoyment in it**. As a result, I turned down the software developer job and instead sought out a QA position. **Fortunately, I found a place where I could engage in writing automated tests right from the start**.

## I assume that back then there weren’t many software testers in the teams?

Oh yes, **I was the only tester in the team**. There was another tester in the company where I worked but I didn't know many other QA Engineers back then. Obviously, **the situation is quite different now**.
