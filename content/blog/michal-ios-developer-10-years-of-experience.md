**MichaÅ‚ worked with Swift since the 1.0 version. For a period of time, he was even a team manager. Some would say that's a usual career path. Yet for him, it was just a turn in a different direction. Eventually, he missed programming too much and came back to his developer roots. ðŸ˜‰ Dive into MichaÅ‚â€™s story!**

## What did your road to iOS development look like? I heard you started from PHP.

Yes, the first language I used at work was PHP. Yet before that, **I actually didnâ€™t want to be a software developer**. I was more interested in hardware than software. I dug electronics so I was thinking about working with Embedded systems. That is why I studied Electronics and Telecommunications at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology.

However, the job market didnâ€™t fit into my plan. There were more offers for software developers than for electronics engineers. So during my studies, I started learning PHP and got my first freelancing job related to it.

Years later, while I was working at a company on a PHP project, they decided to start building iOS apps. I made a move to that new iOS team. **I figured that building apps for phones would be in some way a comeback to hardware. That is how my iOS adventure began**.

## What was the iPhone you built your first apps for?

It was an **iPhone 3GS** with an iOS 5.0 system. It was around 10 years ago.
