## Great geo-localization and flight connections

You can fly to over 20 countries from Gdansk Airport ([data](https://www.airport.gdansk.pl/lotnisko/aktualnosci/80-polaczen-do-24-krajow-n2234.html) from March 2023). Thanks to the Gdansk's great localization in the center of Europe, flying to some cities like Copenhagen, Oslo, and Munich takes even less than two hours.

What’s more Gdansk Airport has [the most direct flights to Scandinavia](https://www.airport.gdansk.pl/lotnisko/aktualnosci/od-kwietnia-nowe-polaczenia-z-gdanska-do-skandynawii--n1706.html) (among Polish airports) including connections to **Tromso, Trondheim, Alesund, Turku, Stockholm, Oslo, Goteburg Vaxjo, Malmo, Billund**, and more. It’s worth mentioning that the Helsinki-Gdansk flights will be back in 2024 according to the [airport website](https://www.airport.gdansk.pl/lotnisko/aktualnosci/wroca-loty-z-gdanska-do-helsinek--n2251.html).

The Gdansk Airport is located about 20 minutes from the center of the city by car (getting to the Bright Inventions office from the airport is even quicker).
