At Bright Inventions, it is very important for us to continuously develop and keep up with hot tech trends. As some of you may have noticed, we have quite a few knowledge-sharing initiatives that we share outside Bright, such as webinars and workshops. Additionally, we also have a lot of initiatives contributing to our development internally. 

If you are curious about what these are and how you can develop after joining our bright team, I invite you to keep reading.

## Learning budget

This is a form of benefit that every employee can take advantage of. It is a pool of money (currently 2k PLN) that each team member can spend during the year on selected courses, conferences or workshops. There is also an opportunity to co-finance a selected learning initiative if the cost exceeds the limit. 

## Bright library 

Each of us can order a book we would like to read - the book related to our further development. These books are 100% funded by the organisation and go into our company library. Everyone can borrow a book, read it at home, and return it afterwards. 

## Bright development time 

This is 8 hours per month that we can spend on things outside the project, but still related to our professional development. This time may be spent on trainings, going to conferences or creating/testing new solutions. 

What is more, Bright development time can be combined with our training budget, eg. you find a course -> the organisation supports you financially > you take bright development time to attend the course -> you create and share with the team a concise summary what you have learnt. 

## Pair programming

This is the opportunity to work together with another developer on code or to solve problems that bother/block us.

## Mentoring programme 

Each of us can take part in a mentoring programme. We have both technology-related mentoring paths to choose from and these related to project management or communication. You choose the area which you would like to go through and a mentor supports you. 

Mentor and mentee meet usually once a month for an hour-long meeting during which they tackle the topic. **How do we explore the new topic?** It could be in any form ex. It can be pair programming, creating presentations, role playing or reviewing. It is entirely up to us. **How long does such a programme last?** This also depends on us and our needs. We agree on this individually with the mentor.

## Coffee talks

A teammate has been to some cool conference, or maybe has learned something totally new or game-changing in a project? Great! They can let people in the team know about it, organise a short 20-minute meeting and share what they have learned. 

## Blogging time 

As you may have noticed we have quite an active blog. :) We really enjoy sharing our ideas and thoughts and what is more, each of us can set aside two hours a week to write a blog post. The topic of the blogpost has to be related to what we do on daily basisi ot more broadly to our industry.

## Internal devs meetings 

Web and mobile developers unite! Every fortnight our developers get together for an internal devs meeting where they discuss news in their technology field for an hour. 

## English lessons

We have the opportunity to participate in free English classes with a professional teacher to improve our language skills. 

## Feedback 1:1s

Apart from the above we have also regular feedback 1:1 meetings with our managers or team leaders, which are a great occasion to exchange ideas and learn. Depending on the needs the frequency of meetings may change. The main goal is to talk through current issue and plan further steps of development. 



As you can see, there are quite a lot of learning initiatives and self-development opportunities in our organisation. Knowledge sharing is just a part of our Bright DNA. We have many opportunities to be able to grow and it depends on our which one we choose. 

If you too would like to join our team and be able to share knowledge inside or outside the organisation, take a look at our [job offers](https://brightinventions.pl/career/) and apply! :)
