At Bright Inventions, it is very important for us to continuously develop and keep up with hot tech trends. As some of you may have noticed, we have quite a few knowledge-sharing initiatives that we share outside Bright, such as webinars and workshops. Additionally, we also have a lot of initiatives contributing to our development internally. 

If you are curious about what these are and how you can develop after joining our bright team, I invite you to keep reading.

## Learning budget

This is a form of benefit that every employee can take advantage of. It is a pool of money (currently 2k PLN) that each team member can spend during the year on selected courses, conferences or workshops. There is also an opportunity to co-finance a selected learning initiative if the cost exceeds the limit. 

## Bright Library 

Each of us can order a book we would like to read (of course, it has to be a book related to what we do at work and our further development. Unfortunately, it cannot be fantasy or crime ;)). These books are 100% funded by Bright and go into our library. Everyone can borrow a book, read it at home, and return it to our library.

## Bright Development Time 

This is 8 hours per month that we can spend on things outside of the project and related to our development. This time can be used for attending training courses, going to a conference or testing new solutions. 



What is more, Bright Development Time can be combined with our training budget, ex. You find a course -> Bright pays for it -> You take Bright Development Time and attend the course.



Pair programming and 1:1 meetings 

This is the opportunity to work together with another developer on code or to solve problems that bother/block us.



Mentoring programme 

Each of us can take part in a mentoring programme. We have a lot of technology-related mentoring paths to choose from, but also topics related to project management or communication. The person interested chooses the topic which he or she would like to go through and a Mentor along with him or her.



Mentor and mentee meet, usually once a week, for an hour-long meeting during which they tackle the topic. 



How do we explore the new topic? It could be in any form ex. It can be pair programming, creating presentations, role playing or reviewing. It is entirely up to us.



How long does such a programme last? This also depends on us and our needs. We agree this individually with the mentor.



Coffee talk

Our teammates have been to a cool conference, or maybe have learned something totally new and game-changing in a project? Great! They can let people in your team know about it, organize a meeting and tell them about it and about what he or she has learned!



Blogging Time 

As you may have noticed we have quite an active blog :) We really enjoy sharing our ideas and thoughts and what's more, each of us can set aside two hours a week to write a blog post. The topic of the blogpost has to be related to what we do and to our industry.



Internal Devs Meetings 

Web and Mobile developers unite! Every fortnight our developers get together for an internal devs meeting where they discuss news in their technology for an hour. :) 



English lessons

We have the opportunity to participate in free English classes with a professional teacher to improve our language skills. :)



As you can see, there are quite a lot of initiatives and sharing knowledge opportunities. Seriously, it is in our Bright DNA! We have many opportunities to be able to grow and benefit from various initiatives. 



And if you too would like to join our team and be able to share knowledge with each other, take a look at our [job offers](https://brightinventions.pl/career/) and apply! :)
