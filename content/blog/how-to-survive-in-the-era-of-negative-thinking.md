Recently I have a constant impression that we are being flooded with negative news and miserable LinkedIn posts. One may say - just log out, but honestly it is not so easy when your job is connected with social media life. Nevertheless, it is hard to stay positive when dozens around go to the opposite direction. How to deal with all this negative psychology, which somehow (I don’t know why) is propagated now so much? Frankly, I just ignore  some information and get on with life. I have accepted that there are things I can affect and some that I cannot change at all. 

### Are you an optimist? 

Am I an optimist? To some extent. But I am also a down-to-earth realist. And what kind of talent do realistic optimists have? They understand what is real and possible and deal with things as they really are. However, at the same time they are cautiously hopeful of favorable outcomes and they do as much they can to obtain the desired results. And how about you? How do you feel now? Do you see everything in as negative and dark light as possible? Or maybe you are the one who always tries to consider the glass half full? In which part of the spectrum are you? 

Don’t get me wrong. Complaining isn’t all bad. Episodic venting negative emotions about some difficulties allow us to get our concerns out into the open and reduce stress reactions. Repressing feelings is not good. But it seem to be that nowadays there are quite many people who complain to feel better about themselves, gain visibility and catch our attention. As they want to influence our perceptions by saying “it is better when everyone around is unhappy as I am unhappy.”

Can we really survive in the era of negative psychology and keep our minds safe? I hope we can. 

### **1. Don’t engage** 

I know how it sounds, but really sometimes it is better stop engaging. Set up some clear boundaries how negative talking may affect you. Be ready to listen, read or help when somebody needs support, but stop engaging if you can see it is repetitive conversations, especially when it happens online in social media arena. Whenever you can read some negative posts on Facebook, Instagram or other platforms, resist the urge to engage and prevent your mind from keeping focus on that. These posts should work for you like a red flag. If you can see people consistently posting critical commentary on their walls or on other people's posts, you might be facing someone who simply is angry and is looking for a reaction.

Do not shift your attention from important things that you value in life to negative emotions of some anonymous “senders”. In many cases it is not worth your time to read them at all. They are often published to increase the reach, not to change anything. Steer clear of hostile and belligerent conversations that can do damage both your mood and to your online presence.

### **2. Cultivate the act of gratitude** 

Start counting your blessings in life. [For sure your mood will improve, you will have more energy and feel better.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2021/01/03/gratitude-is-good-why-its-important-and-how-to-cultivate-it/?sh=49fe180e2a0f) Do not fall into victimhood every time something does not follow according to your plan. There are many simple things happening every day in our life which are worth our appreciation. Try to see silver lining in each of them.

Gratitude is a powerful positive force. In the [Review of Communication Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15358593.2017.1293836) we can read that it has a real impact on physical health, emotional wellbeing. There is no reason not to practise it. 

### **3. Leave the pandemic mode** 

The pandemic has made us definitely much more tired and fatigue and while it has been and still is demanding time for us, we have to learn how to deal with it just to stay mentally healthy. We have to shift out of emergency mode into ongoing monitoring of the pandemic mode. 

Consume the news in moderation. While it is important to stay informed and up to date on the latest information about the Coronavirus, too much information adds to our stress levels.\

Pandemic stress is really killing people, so learn how to deal with it. If you are not sure what works for you, you can take a look at an illustrated guide [Doing What Matters in Times of Stress](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240003927?gclid=Cj0KCQiA3rKQBhCNARIsACUEW_aM6dvHWGGYtDf879ZR0pvTxxj044tLgkzpzZdrD7BciZRUAg81DVwaAgmNEALw_wcB) created by World Health Organisation’, in which you can find five sections containing ideas and techniques that can help reduce stress. If simple methods do not help, it is time to see a specialist or some community supporters. 

### **4. Give up negative pearls of wisdom** 

In online reality I happen to come across  negative pearls of wisdom like “don’t trust people”, “your teammates are not your friends”, “recruiters are dumb” etc. Seriously? I am always thinking why people are writing this kind of stuff. It is like repeating all the way round the same stereotypes and generalisations. 

Every situation is different. Every organisation is different. Every boss is different. And every team is different. Do not assume anything just because someone had a problem and is whining online about that. You might be among “lucky” ones who are working in a healthy work environment where people really support each other and were the boss is not a dic*. And it is POSSIBLE. Really. I would even say that is quite common. These are not exceptions one in million. 

I am really for limiting the negative content we may absorb. Get inspired by people who aim for better, who can help you take a different perspective and who look at the world with compassion, not though the eyes of hers inner critic and hurt ego. 

### **5. Establish new positive patterns** 

For sure you have heard about [dopamine, serotonin](https://atlasbiomed.com/blog/serotonin-and-other-happy-molecules-made-by-gut-bacteria/) or our dearest friend - [cortisol](https://atlasbiomed.com/blog/how-to-lower-cortisol-levels/). I have been reading a lot about the chemicals in our brains that control behaviour. The more you know about how your brain works, the more you can [cope with stressful situations](https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/7-ways-mentally-strong-people-handle-stress-effectively.html). 

It is completely normal that we have negative thoughts. [The evolutionary history shows that we have been always on the lookout for problems and dangers just to survive.](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/fight-or-flight-why-our-caveman-brains-keep-getting-confused) And the the problem is not that we have negative thoughts, but that we believe our thoughts are true. 

When you find yourself dwelling on negative things, look for an activity or a positive thought that will pull yourself out of this negative mindset. Positive thoughts are harder. They take more effort. You have to develop new patterns and new ways of thinking. Don’t allow one situation to dominate your thinking and negative emotions arise. 

We have to learn how to deal with intense negative emotions. Dr Daniel Siegel presented a simple tried and tested technique for untangling from negative thoughts without struggling with them. It’s called “[name it to tame it”](https://heartmindonline.org/resources/strong-emotions-name-it-to-tame-it).  As soon as you name the mental story or pattern, you can step back from being caught up in it. 

### **Positive thinking is like a muscle** 

All around us we can find failures, problems, traumas and my aim is not to ignore them, but to learn how to live with them without constant feeling of being overwhelmed with negative emotions. We should practice positive thinking just as we practise physical exercises. Positive thinking is like building a muscle. The more you use it, the mentally fitter and stronger you will become. Do not get preoccupied with negativity in social media. It is not worth your life.
