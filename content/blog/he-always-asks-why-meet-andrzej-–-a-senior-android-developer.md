**Andrzej is one of the most experienced mobile devs at Bright Inventions. He is a master of digression. So conducting this interview was a challenge. üòâ  However, he goes straight to the point when it comes to advising clients on the best solutions to reach their business and tech goals. He always offers honest and valuable feedback. Because his job isn't just about writing code. It is much more than that. Find out what that is.**

## Where did your passion for software development come from?

I think that it is all because I am inquisitive. Or maybe ‚Äúoverly curious‚Äù ‚Äì some would say. **üòâ**   I just love to explore things and understand them. My adventure with computers probably started when I was a kid. First, I learned a few commands on my father‚Äôs Atari 65XE when I was about 6 years old or so. 

Later on, still in elementary school, my friend who was 5 years older than me taught me the basics of HTML. Also, he told me how to view the HTML files using Internet Explorer (on Windows 98). I suppose it had taken place even before I used the internet for the first time in my life.

A couple of years later, in middle school, I was exploring all Polish web directories for various software, apps, games etc. I was downloading lots of them to check them out. At some point, **I found an app for creating algorithm flowcharts and executing programs created that way** (if you are curious, here it is). That was a game-changer for me. 

After that, **I started to learn the basics of C++** so I could finally write my first command-line application. It all brought me to the high school class with advanced Math, Physics and Informatics. On top of that, in high school I met a very supportive Computer Science teacher, Andrzej Gac.

## Let me guess. üôÇ Then you studied Computer Science?

Yes. I studied Computer Science at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology as many people at Bright Inventions. Nevertheless, **I didn‚Äôt start my career as a software developer as you might assume**. During my studies, I couldn't make up my mind whether I wanted to be a programmer or a system administrator.

Eventually, I got an internship at a corporation which turned into a full-time job. **I was someone who now would probably be called a DevOps but that term wasn‚Äôt so popular back then**. Therefore, my position was called Software Configuration Management Engineer (SCME). A little bit long, isn‚Äôt it?

I must say that being ‚ÄúSCME‚Äù taught me a lot. It gave me knowledge about continuous integration practices, the software development lifecycle, working efficiently with Jira, a couple of version control systems (including Git), remote terminals (SSH), Linux systems and more. Due to the fact that I worked for a global corporation, I learned a lot about developing software on a big scale. 

I wrote some code at that job. That was mostly some short scripts though. I didn't write applications or firmware. However, **after a couple of years, I wanted to pursue a software development career**. I enjoyed writing code and felt that I was quite good at it. 

## Why Android Development?

After almost 3 years in the corporate world, I decided to hand in my notice. When I did it I had no clue what to do next. I didn‚Äôt have any other job offer on the table. **My plan was to take a break for 4-8 weeks to figure out what was next**.

My wife was my rock back then. Actually, she pushed me to quit that job. She believed that I had the potential to do something more. Also during that time, she convinced me to go back to college. I already had an Engineering degree but thanks to her I was back at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology to graduate from Master‚Äôs studies in Computer Science.

When I decided to quit, I started to research the job market in the area. As a result, I felt strongly about pursuing mobile development. **I liked the fact that building a mobile app allows you not only to implement UI but also to build the whole logic**. So it was like a whole package for me. Also, in mobile development you quickly see the results of your work which gives you lots of satisfaction. 

I chose Android over iOS because it is easier to start learning Android. I didn‚Äôt have a Macbook or iPhone so how could I possibly go down this road? Android seemed interesting so I started to learn it. During one month I built my first Android app and launched it on Google Play. It is still there actually. 

## Soon after that, you joined Bright Inventions. How did that happen?

I launched my Android app so it was high time to seek a job. I found a Bright Inventions job offer during my research and it drew my attention. I got this feeling that Bright was a company with friendly people who worked closely and supported each other to reach common goals. This company just felt human. After working at the corporation I wanted to be a part of a small and close team. 

I was invited for the interview. I was terrified when I came. I had only a month of Android experience. What if that wasn‚Äôt good enough? My wife supported me quite nearby, waiting in the coffee shop close by during the whole interview. 

I felt that my interview went fine. For sure, there were questions I couldn't answer but overall I felt that it was okay. After talking to [Micha≈Ç](/about-us/michal/), [Daniel](/about-us/daniel/) and [Piotr](/about-us/piotr/) I **felt that I really wanted to be a part of this company. I would manage to do this job. I wanted someone to give me the chance and I felt that I wouldn‚Äôt let them down**.

Daniel and Michal told me they needed a week to give me feedback. Despite that, I was so anxious that I called Micha≈Ç a few days after the interview to ask if they made up their minds. I told Micha≈Ç that I was eager to work with them and couldn‚Äôt wait to hear their decisions. **Years later I was told that that phone call actually gave me this job**.
