**Andrzej is one of the most experienced mobile devs at Bright Inventions. He is a master of digression. So conducting this interview was a challenge. üòâ  However, he goes straight to the point when it comes to advising clients on the best solutions to reach their business and tech goals. He always offers honest and valuable feedback. Because his job isn't just about writing code. It is much more than that. Find out what that is.**

## Where did your passion for software development come from?

I think that it is all because I am inquisitive. Or maybe ‚Äúoverly curious‚Äù ‚Äì some would say. **üòâ**   I just love to explore things and understand them. My adventure with computers probably started when I was a kid. First, I learned a few commands on my father‚Äôs Atari 65XE when I was about 6 years old or so. 

Later on, still in elementary school, my friend who was 5 years older than me taught me the basics of HTML. Also, he told me how to view the HTML files using Internet Explorer (on Windows 98). I suppose it had taken place even before I used the internet for the first time in my life.

A couple of years later, in middle school, I was exploring all Polish web directories for various software, apps, games etc. I was downloading lots of them to check them out. At some point, **I found an app for creating algorithm flowcharts and executing programs created that way** (if you are curious, here it is). That was a game-changer for me. 

After that, **I started to learn the basics of C++** so I could finally write my first command-line application. It all brought me to the high school class with advanced Math, Physics and Informatics. On top of that, in high school I met a very supportive Computer Science teacher, Andrzej Gac.

## Let me guess. üôÇ Then you studied Computer Science?

Yes. I studied Computer Science at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology as many people at Bright Inventions. Nevertheless, **I didn‚Äôt start my career as a software developer as you might assume**. During my studies, I couldn't make up my mind whether I wanted to be a programmer or a system administrator.

Eventually, I got an internship at a corporation which turned into a full-time job. **I was someone who now would probably be called a DevOps but that term wasn‚Äôt so popular back then**. Therefore, my position was called Software Configuration Management Engineer (SCME). A little bit long, isn‚Äôt it?
