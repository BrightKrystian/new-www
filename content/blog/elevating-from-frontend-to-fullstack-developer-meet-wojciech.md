## How did your passion for programming spark?

It was purely coincidental. I didn’t have a clear career path in mind. I initially chose to study Electronics and Telecommunications, but I found little enjoyment in it. The only classes that truly piqued my interest were mathematics and programming. Consequently, **I decided to switch paths and delve into the fields of Informatics and Econometrics**.

## How did you start to work at Bright Inventions?

**My journey to Bright Inventions has an interesting twist**. Initially, I aimed to work as a frontend developer and accepted a job offer from a different company. However, I still had an interview planned for the position at Bright Inventions. Already landing another job, I didn't approach that interview as thoroughly as I should have. I began working elsewhere, gradually transitioning into a role as a mobile developer, which, while adjacent to frontend work, was different from what I aspired to do. 

**My friend — who also happened to be my college professor — highly recommended Bright Inventions and encouraged me to reapply**. However, it was Ula who reached out to me around 6 months after my failed interview, asking if I was open to trying again. I immediately said “yes” and finally joined the company. This adventure has been ongoing for almost 4 years now.

## Frontend or backend — which one is closer to your heart?

I used to distinguish between frontend and backend, but now **I don't separate them anymore**. At Bright Inventions, my position at first was a frontend developer, but I gradually acquired backend skills. Nowadays, I prefer taking a holistic view of the project. **I appreciate a full-stack role because approaching projects comprehensively is more intriguing and better supports the business**.

The only downside of being a full-stack developer is the constant need to learn, and keep up with updates, and news. **It requires a lot of effort to stay in the loop**. Nevertheless, I'm completely fine with it. I've always aimed to grow, so it aligns well with my ambitions.

## What types of projects do you enjoy the most?

I'm drawn to non-trivial projects with complex domains. **The more intricate the domain, the greater the challenge for a developer**. Simple applications, even with significant revenue, tend to lose their appeal quickly. In complex domains, the intriguing challenges begin right from the architecture design phase.

Currently, **I'm part of a team developing a transport management system for a forwarding company**. This project has numerous moving parts — yet not the typical pivots seen in startups. For instance, we have to ensure compliance with the new highway payment regulations in Germany. **Our system is relied upon daily by our clients, so there's a strong sense of responsibility, which is also incredibly rewarding**.
