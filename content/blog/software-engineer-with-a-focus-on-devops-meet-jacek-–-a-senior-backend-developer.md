## You started your career as R&D Engineer. Share with us your road to becoming a software developer.

I studied **Automatic Control and Robotics** at Gdańsk University of Technology. During my master's studies, I chose **Signal Processing** as my specialty. My college cooperated with a Swedish college – Blekinge Tekniska Högskola, so I got a chance to study for one semester in Karlskrona. I also did my master's thesis there because they greatly focused on learning through practice. Thanks to that university I wrote my thesis in cooperation with an IT company in Gdańsk. It was a real project for a real company, no theoretical work. What’s more, this company eventually offered me a job, so I joined them.

**I started my career as an R&D engineer** working closely with IoT. My stack was mostly **Python and Raspberry Pi** at first. Then I started to learn **Java and DevOps** due to the company’s needs. That’s when I got to know about **pipelines, Kubernetes, automation**, etc. Eventually, I learned **Kotlin**.

## From Python to Kotlin. That’s an interesting journey.

**Python is a great language to start** your programming career. It’s greatly utilized in data science and artificial intelligence. However, **Java and Kotlin are much more friendly to use** **in web development**. For me, **Kotlin is a golden mean between Java and Python**. You get to use all the awesome libraries, tools and practices from Java, but the syntax is really clean and pleasant like in Python. That's why I like working with it.
