## IoT for retail and restaurants

The Internet of Things is greatly utilized in the retail and restaurant industry. A perfect example is the **point of sales system which enables a customer to check out at a store or cafe**.

Let’s think about typical devices you could find while checking out in a restaurant. They, in fact, create an **IoT retail network**. There is a Point of Sale desktop (this huge screen that might divide you and a cashier in the restaurant). It's a core of the retail IoT network. **POS desktop** **with a dedicated app** enables one to sum up all clients' orders and send the information about the final costs to the **receipt printer** as well as to the **payment terminal**.

All of these devices have to be **connected with Bluetooth or WiFi** to enable checkout in every restaurant and practically at every retail business. It wouldn’t happen without IoT.

The fact that you pay with your card and then receive a printed receipt means that you are a “beneficiary” of a retail Internet of Things technology.
