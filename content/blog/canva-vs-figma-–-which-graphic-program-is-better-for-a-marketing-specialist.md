**Every marketer, particularly a social media specialist, should have basic graphic design skills. Canva and Figma are some of the most useful graphic tools for marketers. Which one of them is better? Letâ€™s compare Figma and Canva from a marketing specialistâ€™s point of view.**

## Prons and cons of Canva

### Great tool for beginners

Lots of templates, photos, icons, and other content make it really simple to create various graphics from social media posts, and posters to infographics. Especially if you havenâ€™t discovered your design instincts yet, **using Canva templates should ensure that you follow design trends**. 

### Canva is a useful for social media ninjas

Social media templates (with recommended post sizes) are a great help for every social media specialist. Obviously don't take them for granted. These sizes change too often so it is better to double-check them at different sources and even publish your design on a testing account. ðŸ˜‰ Social media admins know the pain when the size should be fine but after publishing the graphic, it doesnâ€™t look as we expected. ðŸ˜‰

### Ready to print graphics

Canva can also be helpful if you create some printouts. For example, it is quite easy to design an invitation based on Canva templates and then you can export it as a high-quality pdf file which will be working perfectly with the printer house. Also, you can choose an option with bleeds if your printing house expects it. Probably you won't design a billboard with Canva but a very easy flyer or invitation may be possible. And thatâ€™s fine, no one should expect marketers to design billboards. ðŸ˜‰

### You can use Canva for free

Canva offers free templates, photos, icons, and more. However, it is fair to say, that if you want to have top-quality content, you should spend some money on the right templates. The best of them aren't free.

### Open for team collaboration

You can team up with other Canva users from your team and work on the design in a common online folder. Super useful option and essential in these digital times.

Letâ€™s take a moment here to price people who worked on graphic designs before everything was stored in the cloud. Oh, you probably donâ€™t know the pain of endless email exchanges with a designer including receiving the 163849 versions of a graphic design after sending 163848 comments. Now, you can work online on the project simultaneously â€“ simply collaborate, not write stupid emails. ;) So sorry for this dinosaur digression. I just used to spend countless hours emailing graphic designers (marketing trauma).

### Company branding one click away

I enjoy the **Brand kit** feature on Canva. It is not a free option, yet pretty useful during day-to-day work. You can provide all basic brand identity info to get easy access to the company logos, fonts, color codes, etc. No more looking for a high-quality file with a logo. No more double-checking a brand hex code color. Everything is in one place, available for the whole team so no one will use the wrong color or logo by mistake.

## Prons and cons of Figma

### Figma is better for more advanced marketers

Figma has been built mostly for product designers, UX & UI designers, etc. So if you are at the beginning of your design path, **Figma might be scary**. It wonâ€™t provide you with templates, default icons, photos, and graphics. So if you donâ€™t feel like working on a design from scratch, Figma is not a tool for you.
