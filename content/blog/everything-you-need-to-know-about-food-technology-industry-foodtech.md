## What is the food tech industry?

Food tech refers to **using technology to improve various aspects of the food industry**, including food production, processing, distribution, and consumption. It encompasses a wide range of applications, from precision agriculture to food safety, and **aims to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and safety of the food system**.

## The global food tech market size

According to [Growth Market Reports](https://growthmarketreports.com/report/foodtech-market-global-industry-analysis#:~:text=Report%20Description,forecast%20period%2C%202022%E2%80%932030.), the global food tech market size was valued at USD 233.6 Billion in 2021. In [2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1238860/food-tech-market-size-worldwide/) the value was USD 220 Billion. It’s expected to surpass USD 385.7 Billion by 2030. 

### The main reasons for this significant growth of the FoodTech market:

* The rapid growth of online food delivery services.
* The rise of e-commerce food services.
* Greater awareness regarding food quality sources and their health benefits. Consumers pay more and more attention to the product they buy which gives a chance to food tech to deliver healthier product alternatives.
* The increasing popularity of veganism and plant-based products. A global survey conducted in 2021 by [Rakuten](https://insight.rakuten.com/infographic-plant-based-food-alternatives-future-or-present/) found consumers are more and more open to trying vegan alternatives. Especially to milk. Over 80% of consumers tried plant-based milk in 2021.
