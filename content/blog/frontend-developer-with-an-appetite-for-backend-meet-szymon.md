**Szymon built his first website in middle school. Heâ€™s a frontend developer with over 5 years of commercial experience. Heâ€™s never been afraid to dig into the backend though. Discover Szymonâ€™s love for React, holistic approach to software development, and dark beer.**

## What do you remember about your programming beginnings?

Since I remember, **computers have always fascinated me**. I wanted to create my own programs. When I was around 12 I made my first attempt to code (WinAPI C++). However, I quickly gave up because the amount of information to learn overcame me.

**Back then the internet wasnâ€™t such a knowledge source as nowadays so it was much more challenging to learn**. I bounced from it like a table tennis ball. **I started to code for real at age of 15, maybe 16**. That is when I did my first so-called commercial projects such as company websites for my family members.

## Your position is Senior Frontend Developer, but the fullstack path is no stranger to you. Do you feel like a fullstack?

The truth is **I started my career as a fullstack**. Then I had **a turn to frontend** because the project I worked on needed a focus on that. In my view, **everyone should be interested in fullstack development** with a less or bigger focus on the backend or frontend.

I wouldnâ€™t call myself a fullstack though. **I am more of a front-end developer with an interest in backend**. Yet, I am not afraid of backend, but the frontend is definitely closer to my heart. All in all, we shouldnâ€™t limit ourselves to one and panic when someone asks us to do something on the other side. If you work in a fullstack team and you want to understand what other team members do, a holistic approach is essential.

## I read in your bio, on our website, that you are in love with React. Why?

I actually first worked with Angular quite some time. I started to learn React because at one of my previous jobs our client expected us to use it. So I started to discover React and realized that **it simplifies many aspects of my work better than Angular**.Â 

React has a great advantage. **You can use it in multiple ways** and each of them will eventually lead to an application fulfilling all requirements. Angular makes you follow strict rules. However, the freedom offered by React can turn into a disadvantage.Â 

**If we assume that love brings pain sometimes, then we can call my relationship with React love**. ðŸ˜‰ Iâ€™m not blindly in love, I see some issues. Nothing is perfect. Maybe we should call it a marriage of convenience? ðŸ™‚

## How come?

The freedom that React offers could be heartbreaking for you in the future. You can really go crazy with React building very unusual things. And if you build a large application, the consequences could be painful. The business logic should be centralized so you could simply inspect it and adjust it if needed. **If you use React too freely and scatter the business logic around, you may end up with an app, that's hard to maintain and scale**. Donâ€™t overuse the freedom that React gives you.

## You joined Bright Inventions only a couple of months ago. What are your thoughts on our team?

After the first months, I can definitely say that there are a couple of factors that make our organization stand out from other IT companies. First of all, **people here are so open**. 

Whenever I need something or have a question to ask I donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to somebody. I know that this person will be helpful and kind. It doesnâ€™t matter what position they hold at the company and what they do. Itâ€™s very encouraging, especially during onboarding, to experience this friendly atmosphere.
