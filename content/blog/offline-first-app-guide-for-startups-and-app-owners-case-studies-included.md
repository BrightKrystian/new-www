## What is the offline-first application?

**Offline-first mobile applications are built to fulfill their purposes with a weak or no internet connection**. In order to do so they need to include a feature that is called offline mode. Offline mode can be built for **iOS and Android applications**.

Offline mode is a way to get access to the app's services without an internet connection. For example, let’s think of the document-sharing app. The app enables you to create a document offline and save it on your phone. As soon as you get the internet connection back the app will synchronize the data and share the document online with people in your organization.

## Business advantages of the offline-first application

There are a couple of business advantages of apps with offline mode:

### Your app is more reliable

Users have access to most features even offline. They’re **not limited by a weak internet connection** and can keep up with their work.

### Your users won’t lose any data

Data provided offline will be stored on the device and then synchronized when the internet connection is sufficient. However, **it's important to keep the users in the loop with the informative UI** (more on that later). So users are aware that data needs to be synchronized. It's essential because users can, unaware of the consequences, lose their offline data by deleting the cache, formatting the phone, or simply uninstalling the app.

### The offline-first approach is a necessity in some industries

While building a mobile solution for industries like **medical care, retail and transportation you have to offer an offline mode** in order to distinguish your product.
