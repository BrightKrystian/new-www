**2021 will become a memory soon and it is time for a little summary of the passing year. We have decided to stop for a moment and think about our bright culture. We asked people to answer a simple yet meaningful question – Why do you work at Bright Inventions? Our Bright Team submitted over 40 answers and let me be clear – the participation was voluntary. No one was forced and never will be to write some puff pieces.**

The 2021 year was definitely the one to remember. Our team was empowered by new bright people, we were ranked among the [Top 40 Blockchain Development Companies](/blog/bright-inventions-among-top-40-blockchain-development-companies/) and have worked on new international projects like [zero-waste app Relevo](/projects/eco-friendly-app/), [CryptoAtlas social platform](/projects/cryptocurrency-platfrom/) or [Bright Treasury app](/projects/bright-treasury/) for Substrate Blockchain networks.

[In 2019 we also asked the team why they work at Bright.](/blog/31-reasons-why-we-love-working-at-Bright-Inventions/) Back then our team consisted of around 20 members. Now we have over 60 people on board! Thus it is time for new perspectives.

1. People around me are super excited about what they do.
2. I experience constant self-development: professional and personal as well.
3.
