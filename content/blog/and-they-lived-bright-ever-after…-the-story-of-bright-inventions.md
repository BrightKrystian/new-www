**Bright Inventions turns 10 in March 2022! :D That has been quite a ride. Let us show you milestones of the past decade that made us who we are: bright, client-oriented and always with a positive attitude.**

## From college buddies to business owners

Our founders [Daniel Makurat](/about-us/daniel/) and [Michał Łukasiewicz](/about-us/michal/) met in 2005 at the Gdańsk University of Technology where they were studying Computer Science. They quickly became friends and after graduating they got a job in a big international corporation. Yet, after a while they felt a bit unmotivated and weary. Looking for space for taking initiatives, they decided to start their own business. Not in the garage but still… ☺️

Their goal was to create a place where people would enjoy their work and can grow. At the same time it should be the place where you can solve interesting programming and business problems and first of all, have an impact on the business decisions you are a part of. 

**That is how Bright Inventions came to life on March 15, 2012.**

## First-ever client

One of the first projects we worked on at Bright was [Motivo cycling workouts application](/projects/motivo). It was launched in the UK. As you can see, that was quite some time ago. The app was a personal cycling coach, offering training plans and indoor cycling workouts.
