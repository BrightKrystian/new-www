**Bright Inventions turns 10 in March 2022! :D That has been quite a ride. Let us show you milestones of the past decade that made us who we are: bright, client-oriented and always with a positive attitude.**

## From college buddies to business owners

![2012 milestone](/images/2012.png)

Our founders [Daniel Makurat](/about-us/daniel/) and [Michał Łukasiewicz](/about-us/michal/) met in 2005 at the Gdańsk University of Technology where they were studying Computer Science. They quickly became friends and after graduating they got a job in a big international corporation. Yet, after a while they felt a bit unmotivated and weary. Looking for space for taking initiatives, they decided to start their own business. Not in the garage but still… ☺️

Their goal was to create a place where people would enjoy their work and can grow. At the same time it should be the place where you can solve interesting programming and business problems and first of all, have an impact on the business decisions you are a part of. 

**That is how Bright Inventions came to life on March 15, 2012.**

## First-ever client

One of the first projects we worked on at Bright was [Motivo cycling workouts application](/projects/motivo). It was launched in the UK. As you can see, that was quite some time ago. The app was a personal cycling coach, offering training plans and indoor cycling workouts.

## Start of the longest cooperation

**Since 2013 we have been working with our client – Practi from Israel.** We assist the client in building ePOS solutions for restaurants across Europe. We have been with them since their startup phase, taking part in their growth as an international retail solutions provider.

> Thanks to that cooperation we have learnt a lot about scalability and supporting the system and the client’s team. We have earned experience in developing products that people rely on because they use them every day at work. We could see how end-users use our solution. Observing their actions was a real lesson indeed. It turned out that they sometimes used our product in different ways than we could ever imagine. That is an experience every software developer should have – really see how end-users interact with your product. – says Piotr Mionskowski – Partner, Tech Leader. 

## Building healthcare apps for chronic disease patients or moms-to-be

[Etventure](https://www.etventure.com) (now EY etventure) and Bright Inventions started to cooperate in 2013. Thanks to that cooperation we could build dozens of mobile healthcare applications for iOS and Android. One of them was a [mobile app for pregnant women](/projects/pregnancy-app/) helping them to experience safe and healthy pregnancy and birth. We also developed the [application for Parkinson’s patients](/projects/solution-for-parkinsons-patients/) which helped manage everyday chronic disease symptoms, the [app for mobile physiotherapy](/projects/mobile-therapy-application) and more.
