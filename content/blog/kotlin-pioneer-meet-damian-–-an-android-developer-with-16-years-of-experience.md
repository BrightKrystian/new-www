**Damian built apps for the very first Android smartphone. Do you even remember that phone? He started to use Kotlin before most developers learned about its existence. He dedicated his time to sharing knowledge about it. Eventually, he became one of the ambassadors of Kotlin. Meet Damian â€“ a Senior Android Developer from Bright Inventions.**

## You are almost 16 years in the business. How did it all start?

I got my first software development job in 2006. At that time I studied externally Computer Science. I chose that field because computers were the only thing that really interested me. Like many others, it all started with gaming. I figured that programming was intriguing because it involved solving problems and that felt exciting.

At my first job, I was developing games for phones. Obviously not for smartphones because they weren't on the market yet. For example, I worked on a Pro Evolution Soccer game. So I started my career as a game dev and I couldnâ€™t be happier about it. I was a dedicated gamer after all. ðŸ™‚ I worked with Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition. Yes, I used tech thatâ€™s dead at this point. ðŸ˜‰

## When did you take a turn into Android?

It happened at my second job around 2008. This was **the first time I got to work with Android**. Back then there was only one smartphone with Android OS. The one and only G1 phone with a very unique slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Maybe some people still remember this phone. ðŸ˜‰

My job was to rewrite the software for Android. **I just loved Android from the first interaction with it**. I could see the tremendous quality improvements made by Android. It was just easier to write code.

I got so into it that I built my own apps after hours. I launched my app for spinning workout enthusiasts just to see how it is to launch something on Google Play. My app helped to create playlists for workouts on your MP3. At some point, I got over 2000 users. Obviously, the app couldnâ€™t survive the streaming era. However, this project gave me many possibilities to learn about Android development.

I changed jobs from time to time but from then **my priority was to always work exclusively with Android**.

## When did you start to use Kotlin?

**I started to use Kotlin when there wasnâ€™t even a stable version of it**. I had the opportunity to use it while developing a project at work from the scratch. Kotlin didnâ€™t even have a 1.0 version back then. 

Kotlin was so unknown to developers that when I tried to talk about it with another Polish dev they thought that I talked about a Polish ketchup brand because it is called Kotlin too. ðŸ™‚ However, Kotlin was then unknown globally, not only among Polish programmers.

**I started to spread the word about Kotlin**. I was a speaker at various events. I also created other content about Jetbrainsâ€™ solution. There was one special video interview I was a part of. The video was [listed by JetBrains as one of the Top 5 Events Recordings about Kotlin in 2015](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/01/kotlin-digest-2015/). Since 2017 I also shared my Android development experiences on my [blog](https://medium.com/@DamianPetla).Â 

## You are a Jetpack Compose enthusiast. What are the pros and cons of it?

Jetpack Compose is a new toolkit to build native UI for Android apps. It is an alternative to XML. Itâ€™s still in the early phase of development. Even though, **my guts tell me that this is the future, just like I felt about Kotlin**. It is much easier to write UI with Jetpack Compose. **Compared to XML, working with Jetpack Compose gives you more control over UI**. Also, you can manage the state of the views and as a result, **you develop UI avoiding more bugs in the process**.

Obviously, the Jetpack Compose library is in its early stages. So it still doesn't work as we expect it to do, for example, there have been issues with the preview. Yet, I guess we all remember that the Android Studio preview had its issues at the beginning as well. It is a typical cycle of life for every new library or language.
