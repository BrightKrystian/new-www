**Damian built apps for the very first Android smartphone. Do you even remember that phone? He started to use Kotlin before most developers learned about its existence. He dedicated his time to sharing knowledge about it. Eventually, he became one of the ambassadors of Kotlin. Meet Damian â€“ a Senior Android Developer from Bright Inventions.**

## You are almost 16 years in the business. How did it all start?

I got my first software development job in 2006. At that time I studied externally Computer Science. I chose that field because computers were the only thing that really interested me. Like many others, it all started with gaming. I figured that programming was intriguing because it involved solving problems and that felt exciting.

At my first job, I was developing games for phones. Obviously not for smartphones because they weren't on the market yet. For example, I worked on a Pro Evolution Soccer game. So I started my career as a game dev and I couldnâ€™t be happier about it. I was a dedicated gamer after all. ðŸ™‚ I worked with Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition. Yes, I used tech thatâ€™s dead at this point. ðŸ˜‰

## When did you take a turn into Android?

It happened at my second job around 2008. This was **the first time I got to work with Android**. Back then there was only one smartphone with Android OS. The one and only G1 phone with a very unique slide-out QWERTY keyboard. Maybe some people still remember this phone. ðŸ˜‰
