**Multi-module app architecture is not something that your users will see. However, app owners will quickly discover the benefits. If you are about to decide on the architecture of your Android solution, consider choosing a multi-module. Here are the top business advantages of multi-module Android apps.**

## Multi-module vs. single-module applications

Let’s start with the basics. What multi-module-apps are and how they are different from single-module solutions?

<div class="important-info"><h2>What is a multi-module approach?</h2><div>It is a modern way to design Android applications’ architecture. Instead of a single-module app, the codebase in multi-module apps isn’t one large monolith. It’s the opposite, it contains separated modules with code.</div></div>

If you plan to build an Android mobile app, you should consider that option with your development team. Why? **Based on our experience in building multi-module apps we listed the advantages of this solution.**

## Advantages of multi-module applications

There are a couple of advantages of multi-module apps:

### Effective development process

Building and testing time might decrease because developers can work only with one module of code. It might also result in speeding up the whole development process and ultimately saving costs.

### Clarity

Small chunks of code are easier to understand and eventually work with. Divided into a reasonable abstraction could be very useful during onboarding. New members of the development team can faster understand the code and start to work with it.

### Interoperability & scalability
