## You studied Nuclear Power Engineering and Nuclear Physics. How did you end up becoming an iOS developer?

Tech gadgets have intrigued me since I was a child, especially phones & smartphones. For most of my teenage years, I was buying broken phones, fixing them, and re-selling them. **I’ve always loved hardware**. However **boring Informatics classes in high school killed any possible passion for software**. I didn’t even know there was a software developer career line. I had this stereotypical vision of a Computer Science student who ended up being this lonely guy living in their mother’s basement. 

So I decided to study **Nuclear Power Engineering** at Warsaw University of Technology and **Nuclear Physics** at Warsaw University because I really enjoyed physics and math. **These studies actually led me into programming anyway**.

## How come?
