**Tomek is an iOS developer with over 5 years of experience. His initial career, as a nuclear power engineer, guided him toward programming. Learn more about his approach to mobile development, and the iOS trends he observes. Also, find out how Tomek overcame job burnout that almost took away his passion for programming.**

## You studied Nuclear Power Engineering and Nuclear Physics. How did you end up becoming an iOS developer?

Tech gadgets have intrigued me since I was a child, especially phones & smartphones. For most of my teenage years, I was buying broken phones, fixing them, and re-selling them. **I’ve always loved hardware**. However **boring Informatics classes in high school killed any possible passion for software**. I didn’t even know there was a software developer career line. I had this stereotypical vision of a Computer Science student who ended up being this lonely guy living in their mother’s basement. 

So I decided to study **Nuclear Power Engineering** at Warsaw University of Technology and **Nuclear Physics** at Warsaw University because I really enjoyed physics and math. **These studies actually led me into programming anyway**.

## How come?

At my first full-time job, **I had a chance to build a power plant simulator**. I felt so limited because **I didn’t have access to the source code**. It was a constant struggle to work with logic blocks when you didn’t have access to the underlying algorithm. I tried to manage on my own, looking for reasons for problems. In the end, finding solutions felt super satisfying. I even **wrote my first commercial application to improve power plant simulations**. I was going deeper and deeper into programming.

What’s more, my two friends were programming in iOS. So I started to learn with them. We even **developed an app for Warsaw University**. At that time the entry threshold to iOS development was high because you had to buy expensive Apple devices. So more people chose Android development because they already had a computer with Windows or Linux to work on. That’s why **we felt it might be easier to establish ourselves in iOS development because the competition would be lower**. 

Finally, I decided to focus completely on programming. I moved to Northern Poland to work as an iOS developer in a local company.
