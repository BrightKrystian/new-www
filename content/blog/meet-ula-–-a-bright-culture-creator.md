## You studied English Philology to eventually got into Marketing and HR. What did this journey look like?

It was a really cool journey. I liked my studies a lot. In fact, I liked all of them. I started with translation studies at English Philology here in GdaÅ„sk. I loved English and I had a few really great English teachers in the past who instilled love for this language in me. But when I was choosing my studies I was also thinking about psychology and marketing. The fun fact is that my maths teacher in the secondary school was encouraging me to take up some engineering studies then. And I liked maths a lot. Generally it was not an easy choice. ðŸ™‚

Anyway, during studies and after them I was translating texts from many different industries and **I loved this diversity, but at the same time I was into marketing a lot**. 

After my first MA I started an internship at a PR agency and at the same time I also decided to begin my second MA studies â€“ marketing ones. I really like the feeling that I know the ins and outs of the field I work in. I remember I did many great practical projects during my studies. There were interesting subjects like creating brand strategies, companyâ€™s missions, preparing business plans, merchandising models etc. Dozens of creative things. I just love the process of creation. After I graduated I started my job at Twitter. At that time I also discovered that what I really needed was one brand and people around it.

## How do you recall working closely with such a big organization as Twitter?

I recall that as a great experience and a good lesson. I think it was a very important part of my professional development. I learned that there are different ways of managing people, micro-management ones and those based on freedom and responsibility that let you grow.

**I was working with dozens of brands from different industries** like Wirtualna Polska, Wedel, ING, Lays, **but also companies like DocPlanner or Booksy which were small startups back then**.  It was a great experience to discover different marketing strategies and work with different business needs. **And for sure the adventure was also visiting California and meeting the team working there including Adam Bein or Jack Dorsey**.
