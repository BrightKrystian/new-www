**Ula is the first non-developer who joined the Bright team over 5 years ago. Now, she is more than a crucial employee. She is our Bright mom (seriously). ðŸ˜‰ She takes care of the recruitment area, employees' well-being and our brand development. No matter what, you can always talk to Ula. And she will find time for you, despite the fact that she is one of the busiest people in the company. ;) Meet Ula â€“ HR and Marketing Manager at Bright Inventions.**
