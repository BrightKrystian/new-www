## You are a fullstack developer. What is closer to you: frontend or backend?

I used to differentiate that but I don’t do that anymore. Now **I look at a system as a whole**. Problems that need to be solved are much closer to my heart. You will find them on the backend and frontend side as well. It’s the same with the technology you use. It shouldn’t be your number one focus. **Solving the problem is more important than the tool you will use to do it**.
