**Agnieszka needs to build products that really make a difference. She is not afraid to work closely with end-users. She loves to see how the product she builds influences somebody's life. She has been a part of Bright Inventionsâ€™ team since 2015 working on mobile apps, integrations with Substrate blockchain, and more. Check out Agnieszkaâ€™s story.**

## You are a fullstack developer. What is closer to you: frontend or backend?

I used to differentiate that but I donâ€™t do that anymore. Now **I look at a system as a whole**. Problems that need to be solved are much closer to my heart. You will find them on the backend and frontend side as well. Itâ€™s the same with the technology you use. It shouldnâ€™t be your number one focus. **Solving the problem is more important than the tool you will use to do it**.

**If you are a good developer, it doesnâ€™t matter what language or technology you use**. If you learned well one language, you will incorporate that knowledge into another language. The idea behind coding is the key. Also, the goal you must achieve. And the language you will use to code the solution is a minor thing compared to those.

## What have been your favorite projects so far?

I have always felt fulfilled when I could work closely with the client and end users. **I enjoy the feeling that I built something which makes somebodyâ€™s work or life easier**. Especially when I can see with my own eyes how it influences end users. That is very rewarding for me. 

## Why did you join Bright Inventions?

I actually knew [Daniel](/about-us/daniel/) and [MichaÅ‚](/about-us/michal/) (co-founders) from studies at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology. We were in the same college group, also with [Piotr](/about-us/piotr/) and [Kasia](/about-us/kasia/). Eventually, all of us found our way to Bright Inventions. ðŸ˜Š

Yet before I joined Bright, I had had another work since college. I spent there a couple of years. I enjoyed that work but at some point, the pressure was really high. I was working closely with end-users. Even though I generally love that, after some years I felt I needed a change of scene. Maybe things could have been different if I had had a project manager in the team who would have supported us in the communication with end users.

In the meantime, MichaÅ‚ and Daniel started their company so I was thinking to join their firm. Back then they mostly specialized in mobile applications and I never worked with mobile. So I hesitated for some time but ultimately decided to join their firm. 

I knew their approach from our college times. **We shared the same values and strongly believed that good programmers are the ones who write good code and solve problems with it, no matter which technology they use**. So I knew that Daniel and MichaÅ‚ wouldnâ€™t have problems with me taking the time to learn mobile from the scratch. 

I had a chance to learn a lot of new technologies here and I am grateful that MichaÅ‚ and Daniel always trusted me with new projects. Even if I had to learn some new stack for a new project they just let me do my thing. I guess I never let them down because I still work here. ðŸ˜€

## You are one of the Bright Inventions team members with the longest seniority. How was it to watch the companyâ€™s growth over those years?

When I joined Bright Inventions in 2015 only 8 people worked here. Now we have over 70 team members.

During that time I had two maternity leaves. When I left for the first time there were 8 people and only a couple more when I came back. But when I left to have my second baby the team was doubled, from 20 to 40 people. Obviously, in terms of organization, some things changed for good, especially after [Ula](/about-us/ula/) joined the company. However, **the essential things became the same. The things that really matter**.

**People still treat each other with respect and you can feel that they do work that really gives them satisfaction**. Also, if I struggle with some technical or communication challenge, **I always have somebody I can talk to** about it and I know we will solve it. **The company has to grow, but the fundaments remain the same**.

## So you changed your work only once? That is quite unusual for our generation, not to mention our industry.

Yes, I tend to become close to my workplace. I need to work at a place where I can really stick around. **I need to feel that the work I do matters. Then I stay motivated**. In order to feel that you also need to have a connection with your employer. When I have that bond I donâ€™t want to move to another work and start that all over again.
