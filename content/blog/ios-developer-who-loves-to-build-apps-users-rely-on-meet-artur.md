## You joined Bright Inventions 5 years ago while you were still at college. How did you start your job here?

I saw a job listing for a blockchain developer position and applied. However, before I had my interview, the position got filled. Yet, **[Michał](/about-us/michal/) decided to still interview me and eventually offered me the position of iOS developer**.

I didn't have any experience with iOS back then. I had maybe 2 classes about it in college. However, I always liked Apple products, so I thought I could go for it. That’s how I became an iOS developer. **Maybe it was a coincidence rather than a conscious decision, but I really enjoy iOS development**.

## How would you compare your challenges at the beginning of your career to now?

Back then, the team was much smaller. There were only 2 other iOS developers at Bright Inventions. Although they were very supportive, I needed to quickly learn a lot on my own. It required a lot of self-organization to find the answers online. **Then, my challenges were related to the learning process, using the programming languages, and how to structure my code**.

Now, I work in a bigger team, and the daily challenges are different. Currently, **we focus on enhancing our communication and creating processes that will help us cooperate effectively**. I work in a team that consists of 6 people. Some would say it’s still a small group, but we really need to communicate well to move the development process forward

So, my first challenge was to effectively manage work on my own. Nowadays, it is all about working effectively as a team.

## And how do you enjoy working with your current team?

I am a part of an experienced and very competent team. It consists of only senior iOS developers who are highly engaged in what they do. We work on a food delivery app available on the Israeli market. I enjoy the fact that our client trusts us; therefore, we can choose the tech stack we use. 

Our team also includes skilled software testers. Although we, as developers, do some tests on our own during the code review, it’s great to share the responsibility. I still feel responsible for my code, but it’s great to feel the reassurance that there are people who will test it as well.

## What projects, that you worked on, are particularly memorable to you?

[Finebite](/projects/everytap/) for sure. **That’s a very popular app in Poland, and it was great to be a part of its development process from the beginning to the launch**. When people find out I am a mobile developer, they often ask me if I've worked on any apps they know. I always mention Finebite, and people recognize it. That’s cool. :)

[Just Eat POS](/projects/system-for-restaurants-mobile/) (prev. Practi) was one of the projects close to my heart as well. It was **a retail platform, very popular, especially in the Israeli market**. We delivered solutions for restaurant owners and their employees. Our users and their businesses relied on our work daily. So, it was a huge responsibility. Yet, it's an advantage of building real solutions, rather than creating applications that will never see the light of day.
