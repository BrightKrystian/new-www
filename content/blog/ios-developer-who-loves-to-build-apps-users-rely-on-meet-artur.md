## You joined Bright Inventions 5 years ago while you were still at college. How did you start your job here?

I saw a job listing for a blockchain developer position and applied. However, before I had my interview, the position got filled. Yet, **[Michał](/about-us/michal/) decided to still interview me and eventually offered me the position of iOS developer**.

I didn't have any experience with iOS back then. I had maybe 2 classes about it in college. However, I always liked Apple products, so I thought I could go for it. That’s how I became an iOS developer. **Maybe it was a coincidence rather than a conscious decision, but I really enjoy iOS development**.
