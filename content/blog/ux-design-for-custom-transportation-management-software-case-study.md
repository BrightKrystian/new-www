**How to design transport management software? What are the challenges and best practices to follow? Let us answer all the questions with a case study!**

<div class="image"><img src="/images/cover_blog_post_ux_logistics.png" alt="UX Transport Management System" title="undefined"  /> </div>

MAKO TSL has reached out to us to build [customized software for freight forwarders](https://brightinventions.pl/projects/transportation-management-system/) to speed up and eventually automate the process of finding suitable transport orders and matching them with the right drivers.

As a result of our work, it takes up to 0.5 seconds to filter out the right transport listings and display them to users. In 1 minute the system analyzes over a thousand orders to display only the ones that meet all the requirements.

However, thatâ€™s just the one challenge of that job. Another was a product design which aim was to support users and help them navigate smoothly through the app.

Drawing from our experience in product design for this project, we want to share our insights on creating products tailored to the shipping industry.

## Challenges for transportation management system design

Information Architecture

* Designing a data-heavy solution in the most possible accessible and readable way.
* Designing how to display as much data as possible on one screen without overwhelming users.

Deep understanding of the domain

* Building work management software requires a true understanding of a particular industry.
* Also, it might turn out that your design instincts go opposite to end users' needs.
