**How to design transport management software? What are the challenges and best practices to follow? Let us answer all the questions with a case study!**

<div class="image"><img src="/images/cover_blog_post_ux_logistics.png" alt="UX Transport Management System" title="undefined"  /> </div>

MAKO TSL has reached out to us to build [customized software for freight forwarders](https://brightinventions.pl/projects/transportation-management-system/) to speed up and eventually automate the process of finding suitable transport orders and matching them with the right drivers.

As a result of our work, it takes up to 0.5 seconds to filter out the right transport listings and display them to users. In 1 minute the system analyzes over a thousand orders to display only the ones that meet all the requirements.

However, that’s just the one challenge of that job. Another was a product design which aim was to support users and help them navigate smoothly through the app.

Drawing from our experience in product design for this project, we want to share our insights on creating products tailored to the shipping industry.

## Challenges for transportation management system design

Information Architecture

* Designing a data-heavy solution in the most possible accessible and readable way.
* Designing how to display as much data as possible on one screen without overwhelming users.

Deep understanding of the domain

* Building work management software requires a true understanding of a particular industry.
* Also, it might turn out that your design instincts go opposite to end users' needs.

## UX persona of the transport management solutions

In this case, end users are freight forwarders who expect fast, precise and simple solutions that will speed up their work. They don’t want beautiful design, images, and animations which might result in slowing the app’s performance. They can’t deal with any distractions as well. They expect the tools that will assist them in matching transport jobs with the right cars and couriers.

**What he says**

"I wonder if a driver has enough time to unload, so I could add another load for him?"

**What he thinks**

“It’s not affordable to take this offer.”

“Weak offer, but I have to make mileage."

**What he does:**

* takes orders from clients and plans the entire route for the driver, 
* ensures that all shipments are delivered on time and in good condition,
* maintains strong relationships with drivers and customers, 
* streamlines dispatching processes to improve efficiency and reduce errors,
* stays up-to-date with industry trends and technologies.

**What he feels:**

* stress,
* time pressure.

## Understanding the business domain – freight forwarding and road transportation

While designing prototypes for the transport management solution our design team used numerous product design techniques:

### Desk research

The process of gathering information and data by reviewing existing literature, documents, reports, and other available resources regarding the shipping industry.

### Benchmarking

It is a process of comparing an organization's products against those of its competitors or industry leaders. It involves identifying best practices, evaluating performance metrics, and using the insights gained to improve and set goals for the organization.

### Field studying

It is a research method that involves directly observing and collecting data in real-world settings or natural environments. From the very beginning of the development process, we had access to end-user representatives who were willing to give us a unique insight into their work life.

### User shadowing

It is an observational research technique used to understand how people interact with products, services, or systems in their natural environment. Bright Inventions’ team visited the client’s office to watch freight forwarders at their work, specifically to see how they interact with various software tools on a daily basis.

### Adaptive interviews

It is a research technique that involves conducting interviews. It allows for a deeper understanding of the interviewee's experiences, opinions, and perspectives.

Our team conducted many interviews during the MVP development process. However, after the MVP launch interviews still remained a powerful tool. After every crucial feature release and design update, we conduct interviews with users and improve the product according to their feedback. 

## Best UX design practices for transportation management software

Creating a visual representation of this app required a data-heavy design approach. It is the process of creating interfaces or systems that effectively handle and display large amounts of complex data. It involves organizing, visualizing, and optimizing the interaction with data to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
