**How to design transport management software? What are the challenges and best practices to follow? Let us answer all the questions with a case study!**

<div class="image"><img src="/images/cover_blog_post_ux_logistics.png" alt="UX Transport Management System" title="undefined"  /> </div>

MAKO TSL has reached out to us to build [customized software for freight forwarders](https://brightinventions.pl/projects/transportation-management-system/) to speed up and eventually automate the process of finding suitable transport orders and matching them with the right drivers.

<div class="image"><img src="/images/tms_social_preview.png" alt="Transport Management System" title="Transport Management System"  /> </div>

As a result of our work, it takes up to 0.5 seconds to filter out the right transport listings and display them to users. In 1 minute the system analyzes over a thousand orders to display only the ones that meet all the requirements.

However, that’s just the one challenge of that job. Another was a product design which aim was to support users and help them navigate smoothly through the app.

Drawing from our experience in product design for this project, we want to share our insights on creating products tailored to the shipping industry.

## Challenges for transportation management system design

Information Architecture

* Designing a data-heavy solution in the most possible accessible and readable way.
* Designing how to display as much data as possible on one screen without overwhelming users.

Deep understanding of the domain

* Building work management software requires a true understanding of a particular industry.
* Also, it might turn out that your design instincts go opposite to end users' needs.

## UX persona of the transport management solutions

In this case, end users are freight forwarders who expect fast, precise and simple solutions that will speed up their work. They don’t want beautiful design, images, and animations which might result in slowing the app’s performance. They can’t deal with any distractions as well. They expect the tools that will assist them in matching transport jobs with the right cars and couriers.

**What he says**

"I wonder if a driver has enough time to unload, so I could add another load for him?"

**What he thinks**

“It’s not affordable to take this offer.”

“Weak offer, but I have to make mileage."

**What he does:**

* takes orders from clients and plans the entire route for the driver, 
* ensures that all shipments are delivered on time and in good condition,
* maintains strong relationships with drivers and customers, 
* streamlines dispatching processes to improve efficiency and reduce errors,
* stays up-to-date with industry trends and technologies.
