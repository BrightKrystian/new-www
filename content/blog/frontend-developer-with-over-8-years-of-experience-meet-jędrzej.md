## You are a frontend developer. Is the backend totally strange to you?

No. **I used to work as a fullstack developer and I worked with servers as well**. I have no problem going to ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù as long as I am familiar with the backend stack used in a project I work on.

## How long do you work as a software developer? How do you recall the beginnings of your career?

I have over **8 years of commercial experience**. My first job started as an internship. I was a part of the internal team which had an ambitious goal to build a to-do list application. **I wrote the backend in PHP with Symfony** which is a hardcore framework with a high entry threshold. 

Eventually, I was offered a full-time job. **I started to learn Angular** which was something new back then. After that, **I turned to React and have been working with this framework for the past 5 years**.

## What is your advice to people who want to become junior frontend developers?

It‚Äôs hard to say because as you know I started to work in this industry years ago. I guess my career began when there weren‚Äôt so many frameworks available. So I naturally focused on getting to know the language. That‚Äôs what I would recommend to future frontend developers. **Focus on understanding the language, not only frameworks**. Language is the basic tool you are going to work with, so don‚Äôt neglect it. Also, you should **understand the basics of algorithms and software design patterns**.

When you possess that knowledge, you can **start to get familiar with popular frameworks like React or Vue**. That's also a great moment to **learn libraries, like styled components or Tailwind for styling and the role of tooling like Webpack** in a project. You don‚Äôt need to know how to configure Webpack, but you should be aware what‚Äôs the purpose of it.

## You have worked at Bright Inventions for over a year. How do you recall joining the company?

I had a couple of interviews scheduled with different companies including Bright Inventions. **Why did I choose Bright? Actually, because of the very intriguing tech interview** I had with [Piotr](/about-us/piotr/) and [Bartek](/about-us/bartosz-sz/). It was a long, 2-hour interview. However, after finishing it I felt that these were the people I wanted to work with. I was happy that the feeling was mutual when I was offered a job.
