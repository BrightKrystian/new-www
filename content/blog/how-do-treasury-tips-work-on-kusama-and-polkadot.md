## What are Treasury tips?

The tip is a reward paid in crypto to somebody who deserves to be rewarded for their activity, a well-done job, or other contributions related to Kusama or Polkadot.

Tips are the Treasury mechanism, along with proposals and bounties. Tips are a reward paid in $DOT or $KSM. You can propose a tip or directly tip somebody. The second option, at the moment, is reserved for Council members only.

## Where can you create a tip suggestion?

The easiest way to suggest a tip is on the [BrightTreasury](https://treasury.bright.dev/tips?utm_source=brightinventions_blog&utm_medium=link_article&utm_campaign=tip&utm_id=content_marketing) page. This is the place where you can create tips without any blockchain technical background. The app was exclusively built to make the Treasury mechanism easy. The app is 100% funded by Kusama and Polkadot nets. The Tip module on BrightTreasury is integrated with Polkassembly. Therefore every tip made via BrightTreasury will be immediately displayed on Polkassembly. 

## How do treasury tips work?

* Tips can be suggested by anyone who has a Web3 address.
* Tips have to be suggested for a particular job which has been done. You cannot suggest a reward for something which is only planned or in progress.
* When you suggest a tip beneficiary, you have to put in a deposit. The bond depends on the reason message length which is stored in the chain. There is also a [fixed bond constant](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury#tipping) defined on-chain (currently 1). The deposit will not be restored if your tip suggestion will be withdrawn.
* Tips are supported and verified by the tipping group. Right now there are only council members there but there is a plan to include other community members.
* The value of the tip is established based on the median of all tips issued in the particular tipping period.
* When you suggest a tip beneficiary, you will receive a 20% percent of the tipping amount if the tip is approved. 
* When the council tips somebody, the fee is not included in that process.

Ready to become a tipper? Here is a step-by-step guide on how to tip somebody via BrightTreasury:

2. Choose the right network (Polkadot or Kusama).

![Create tip BrightTreasury](/images/create_tip_form_blank.png)

* There are two options: ‚ÄúI want to propose‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want to tip‚Äù. The latter is enabled for a tipper‚Äôs account holders. At this moment only Council members have that account. So if you are not a part of the Council, click on ‚ÄúI want to propose‚Äù.

![Tipping two options](/images/tip_options.png)

* Now you can provide the title of your Tip suggestion. For example: ‚ÄúReward for a series of YouTube videos about developing in Substrate‚Äù.
* Then you enter the beneficiary Web3 address.
* Now you can provide a reason ‚Äì it should be concise because it is going to be stored in the chain.
* The deposit will be calculated automatically based on the number of bytes of the provided reason.
