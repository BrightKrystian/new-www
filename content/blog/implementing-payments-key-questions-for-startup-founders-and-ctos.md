**Payment is one of the most important features of digital products. In case any problems arise, both you and your users could potentially experience financial losses. So based on our over 10 years of experience in building digital products, we gathered some recommendations for payment implementation for startup founders, CTOs, and tech leaders.**

Payment can enable you to monetize your solution. Or it can be an important feature for your users. For example, if you offer a retail POS solution, payment is the heart of it. If there are any issues with it, your clients will lose money. **The success of payments doesn't solely depend on your development team's code but rather on the business decisions you make** before any programming lines are written.

**Things to consider before you add a payment feature to the software development team’s backlog:**

## 1. Do you need the payment for international markets or locally?

If you need to implement payments for a specific country, it might be wise to seek a local provider that is well-versed in the market's nuances and regulations. However, if you need to facilitate international payments, your payment provider probably should be one of the top players, such as Stripe, PayPal, and Zettle by PayPal.

## 2. Do you need a small provider or a top player on the market?

There is no ideal option for everyone, so you need to analyze the pros and cons from your business perspective. The final decision often relies on the size of your organization. Startups and SMEs will likely have different needs compared to large enterprises.

### Advantages of large payment providers:

* Stable and mature payment solution.
* Technical support.
* Lots of helpful resources and docs for software engineers.

### Disadvantages of large payment providers:

* Possible slow response time from support (if you're small, you’re not a key client).

* Less attractive price models (the smallest volume, the bigger price).
