We discussed the situation of women in tech in [an interview with our bright Senior Project Manager Kasia](/blog/meet-kasia-a-project-manager-and-an-academic-teacher) who is an academic teacher at the Department of Software Engineering at the Gdańsk University of Technology. Check out [Kasia’s thoughts on the situation of Polish female STEM students](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/meet-kasia-a-project-manager-and-an-academic-teacher/#what-does-the-female-students-situation-at-it-look-like-can-you-see-that-there-are-more-women-studying-than-there-used-to-be). 

Even if Poland looks quite well in the HackerRank above, there is much to be done for women in software development in Poland.

Fortunately, **the Polish tech world knows that and organizes mentoring programs, courses, competitions, and more initiatives** whose goal is to encourage women to pursue careers in engineering, especially in software development.
