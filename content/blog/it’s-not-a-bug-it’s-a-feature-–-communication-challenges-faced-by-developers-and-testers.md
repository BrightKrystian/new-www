**There are many misunderstandings between testers and developers in their daily work. We’ve gathered our experiences to show you some common triggering situations that can be easily solved. It takes a bit of work from both sides but the friendly atmosphere at work is worth it.**

## How to report a bug?

It is obvious that how we report a bug has an impact on the developer’s reaction. 

I’ve noticed that sometimes junior developers feel like a bug is their mistake. This is a challenge to report an issue in such a way that the dev can feel that a bug belongs to all of us. How to do this?

I think this is a difficult question. All of us are different, but there are some rules QA should follow. Firstly I think we should consider if we need to contact the software developer or just create a new bug in our issue tracker. Let’s focus on the first one as the second is easy. 

Sometimes it’s better to write or talk with a developer about an issue. **The receipt is easy: remember that a bug is ours, not mine or yours**. With this mindset, the relationship will be much simpler. 

Before you decide to ping a developer you should be sure that your bug is a bug. After that, provide details and conduct the conversation as if you were talking about a common goal. 

## But it's not a bug…

It happens that you hear “it's not a bug”. You can protect yourself from this kind of response in several ways. For example by reproducing the bug path several times or by reading the documentation carefully. But no matter what you do, sometimes it just happens, and there are two possible paths to what will happen next.

In fact, it's a bug. If you are sure of your right, you will have to prove it somehow to a developer. Prepare a set of evidence like relevant parts of the documentation, feature requirements, and ticket description or if you don't have any of them, prepare a good explanation of why the raised issue is painful for end users. Yet don't try to “kill” anyone with your evidence, it's really not the point. Try to have a constructive conversation and work together on achieving a similar point of view.

During my career, I've been several times in a situation, where despite my huge effort and certainty, the issue I raised has been marked as non-bug. I’ve presented the requirements from the feature ticket, I’ve pointed out an inconsistency in the software, I’ve explained why the given behavior of the app might be confusing to users, and all of this went for nothing. It was just moved to “Won’t do”, end of the story. The only comment on that is if you ever face a similar situation, **you should keep in your head that you did your best and you can’t fix everything**.

And what if it's really not a bug? It may happen that you will miss some details that distort your point of view, or you just won’t foresee some use cases because you are fresh in a project. Try to learn a lesson from it for the future.
