**There are many misunderstandings between testers and developers in their daily work. We’ve gathered our experiences to show you some common triggering situations that can be easily solved. It takes a bit of work from both sides but the friendly atmosphere at work is worth it.**

## How to report a bug?

It is obvious that how we report a bug has an impact on the developer’s reaction. 

I’ve noticed that sometimes junior developers feel like a bug is their mistake. This is a challenge to report an issue in such a way that the dev can feel that a bug belongs to all of us. How to do this?

I think this is a difficult question. All of us are different, but there are some rules QA should follow. Firstly I think we should consider if we need to contact the software developer or just create a new bug in our issue tracker. Let’s focus on the first one as the second is easy. 

Sometimes it’s better to write or talk with a developer about an issue. **The receipt is easy: remember that a bug is ours, not mine or yours**. With this mindset, the relationship will be much simpler. 

Before you decide to ping a developer you should be sure that your bug is a bug. After that, provide details and conduct the conversation as if you were talking about a common goal.
