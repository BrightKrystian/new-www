## First, be empathic

Don't scroll down, because you feel it's obvious. Is it, though? Do you treat your current or future app users merely as clients? This mindset might be suitable for retail, fintech, or other sectors, but not in digital health. HealthTech businesses must be strongly founded on a mission; otherwise, they probably won't survive. Your users aren't just users. They are real people with real-life struggles, often forced to manage chronic diseases all their lives. If you don’t try to understand your users’ experience, you won’t build a product that will be appealing to them.

## Start from workshops to scrutinize your idea and target groups

You might have an idea for an eHealth solution, but that's not even the first step to succeeding in healthcare software development. You should attend product discovery workshops that will help you understand your potential customers.

## Validate your idea and business approach with an MVP

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the most efficient way to validate your idea. In a cost-effective and timely manner, you can launch the first version of your product with key features to receive vital feedback from end-users.

Before the launch, you should set up analytics metrics to measure your goals. Check out our MVP success metrics cheat sheet:

## Create simple design

UX design is a crucial factor in ensuring a successful user experience for your solution. Depending on your end users, you might need to design for older people less familiar with technology, who might be skeptical about your solution. The design must immediately demonstrate value, enable smooth navigation, and manage the handling of vast amounts of information, which is often the case for eHealth apps.

## Evaluate your app onboarding

Most software solution faces a crucial challenge: designing the onboarding process to increase the number of registered and (already) engaged users. Our experience, especially in healthcare software development, suggests creating a longer onboarding process to demonstrate your commitment to users and tailor the app to their personal experiences.

Examine the story of the [FemTech pregnant women engagement app](/blog/data-driven-development-femtech-app-onboarding/) whose shortened onboarding process led to a decrease in the number of completions.
