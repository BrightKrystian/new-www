**Invisible diseases represent a vast group of patient disorders. Developing software for people suffering from them requires an extra empathetic approach to deliver a truly user-centric experience. Are you prepared to create a credible and trustworthy solution? Read our article to find out!**

People with invisible diseases often navigate their lives, both private and professional, while managing their conditions. These conditions are typically chronic, remaining with them for longer periods, even though their symptoms may not be visible to others.

Invisible diseases include mental health issues, neurodiverse conditions like ADHD and autism, chronic pain and fatigue conditions such as fibromyalgia, as well as autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS) and lupus.

## Patient-centric approach in healthcare software solutions

Developing technology solutions for patients with invisible diseases may require additional effort to achieve a user-centric approach. 

### Throughout the process of understanding your users, it's essential to consider several factors:

1. Your users may be very secretive about their disease. Understanding the privacy concerns and stigma associated with invisible diseases is crucial in building trust and ensuring user comfort.

<blockquote><h2>Breaking down the encrypted database</h2><div>One of the security tactics we implemented was breaking down the encrypted database into two – each stored in a different AWS services’ physical location. The first database stored basic user data, such as name or email address. The second database kept sensitive medical information, including medication intake or physical symptoms and side effects. Through this decision, we made sure that – in case of a data breach – the attacking party wouldn’t be able to access all the information. This way, there were virtually zero chances of matching symptoms or medication intake to specific patients’ names.</div><footer>Mateusz Klimczak, Partner & Head of Delivery at Bright Inventions</footer></blockquote>

2. People with invisible diseases may be distrustful, including towards technology. Initially, they might approach your app with a degree of skepticism, making the onboarding process more critical than ever. Crafting an engaging, reassuring, and personalized onboarding experience is key to overcoming initial mistrust.
