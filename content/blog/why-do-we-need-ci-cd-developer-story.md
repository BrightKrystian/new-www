**Why would you spend time on configuration and maintenance of CI/CD flow for your application? Do the gains justify the effort? And what exactly do you get when you start using CI/CD?**\
**Two bright developers with a lot of experience in DevOps and automation will explain why, in their opinion, CI/CD is a must have element of any system.** 



# 1. It adds value to the company's portfolio

The clients will be more willing to choose a company that offers CI/CD automation instead of competition.

When searching for a new job opportunity I would definitely look for a company that utilises CI/CD tools.

# 2. It is an always up-to-date documentation of the release process

When I need to check how the application is deployed, how to run the tests and what are the parts of the system, I am first looking for the pipeline configuration instead of README file.

# 3. It gives a fast feedback for the developer every time he pushes his changes

# 4. It keeps the team confident in their changes

# 5. It allows quick deployment of new application version
