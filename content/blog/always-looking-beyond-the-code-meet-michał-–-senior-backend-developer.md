**Michał wanted to be a soldier but became a programmer. He regrets nothing. As senior backend developer and tech lead at Bright Inventions, he focuses on solving clients’ problems. Scala, Java, or Kotlin… He has worked with all of them and is open to learning almost any other language. Code is just a tool helping him to solve challenges. Read Michał's story.**

## Have you always planned to be a software developer?

Actually, **I wanted to go to military school** but my girlfriend at that time talked me out of it. Now I am glad that I chose software development.

## You are a backend dev with Java roots. How do you recall your career beginnings?

I guess it all happened quite ordinary. I went to the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. During my studies, in 2014, I got my first programming job. I was hired as a mobile developer but I never got to be one.

I was supposed to build apps for now forgotten Windows Phone. Fortunately, as soon as I joined the company they opened a new project for backend devs and I joined that team. Then my adventure with Java began. 

After that, I worked on another project developing a solution for a startup whose aim was to utilize Bluetooth beacons to analyze traffic. Our stack was based on Scala. We worked on a solution that would use beacons in the cars to communicate between them and analyze traffic jams and other situations on the road. In order to verify such a solution, we were creating traffic simulations and predictions of when and where the jam would occur. That was interesting because it was also related to my Engineering Thesis.
