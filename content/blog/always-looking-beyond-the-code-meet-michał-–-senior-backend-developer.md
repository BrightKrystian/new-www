**MichaÅ‚ wanted to be a soldier but became a programmer. He regrets nothing. As senior backend developer and tech lead at Bright Inventions, he focuses on solving clientsâ€™ problems. Scala, Java, or Kotlinâ€¦ He has worked with all of them and is open to learning almost any other language. Code is just a tool helping him to solve challenges. Read MichaÅ‚'s story.**

## Have you always planned to be a software developer?

Actually, **I wanted to go to military school** but my girlfriend at that time talked me out of it. Now I am glad that I chose software development.

## You are a backend dev with Java roots. How do you recall your career beginnings?

I guess it all happened quite ordinary. I went to the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. During my studies, in 2014, I got my first programming job. **I was hired as a mobile developer but I never got to be one**.

I was supposed to **build apps for now forgotten Windows Phone**. Fortunately, as soon as I joined the company they opened a new project for backend devs and I joined that team. Then **my adventure with Java began**. 

After that, I worked on another project developing a **solution for a startup whose aim was to utilize Bluetooth beacons to analyze traffic**. Our stack was based on **Scala**. We worked on a solution that would use beacons in the cars to communicate between them and analyze traffic jams and other situations on the road. In order to verify such a solution, we were creating traffic simulations and predictions of when and where the jam would occur. That was interesting because it was also related to my Engineering Thesis.

## After all these years in the business do you think it is possible to be a backend dev without knowing platforms like AWS, Azure or Google Clouds, etc?

Over the course of my career, I had opportunities to build many cloud solutions so this area is close to my heart. Based on my experience I think it all depends on the organization you are a part of.

It is usually **easier and cheaper to use cloud computing platforms by small companies**. However, there are still companies that use their own servers or build native cloud solutions. 

In the end, **it is a business decision**. Many of us followed the [Dropbox case](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/why-dropbox-decided-to-drop-aws-and-build-its-own-infrastructure-and-network/). They did the math and decided to use their own servers and hire people to manage them.

On the other hand, there are **companies that use all of the cloud computing providers** out there. Especially the ones that build security solutions and cannot risk any downtown. 

No matter the company you are part of, I believe **it is important for backend developers to stay up to date with top cloud providersâ€™ solutions**.

## What will backend development look like in the next 5-10 years? What are your predictions?

For sure, tools will be still evolving. Therefore **there will be less technical work to do and more time to actually solve our clientâ€™s problems**. And I think thatâ€™s great. When you work at a software agency client expects you to solve problems, not to play with tech.

## How did you join Bright Inventions? And why?

I donâ€™t remember how I came across Bright for the first time. Probably I started to follow the company on social media. **I remember that Bright always had a positive vibe**. Even when I was only an observer I had this feeling that positive and professional people worked there. I also knew some programmers who worked there and they confirmed my assumptions.Â 

**So finally I applied for a job. Actually, I wasnâ€™t hired then.** ðŸ˜‰ Nevertheless, I got very positive feedback from [Ula](/about-us/ula/). Kudos to her. **Despite the fact that Bright didnâ€™t choose me they provided me with such great feedback that I was even more eager to join there**. Ula told me they chose someone else but they were impressed with me so she promised to contact me when another suitable vacancy would be open. She did as she said. Soon after that, she contacted me. **Eventually, I joined Bright Inventions**.

## At Bright, you had a chance to be a tech lead of the team working for the international JET POS brand. What did you learn as a tech lead?

Although my position was called by a client a tech lead, **I think that my responsibilities actually matched a team leader role**. Leaving aside the naming, this role gave me a new perspective on the software development process.
