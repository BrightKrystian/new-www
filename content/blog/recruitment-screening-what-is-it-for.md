In this blog post, you will learn what screening is, why it is used in recruitment, and what questions you can expect from the recruiter.

Screening in recruitment is typically a short, fifteen to thirty-minute phone or video conversation after the recruiter has reviewed the candidate's CV.

The purpose of screening is to verify candidates for a specific job position and present initial preferences, and requirements of the employer. Through screening, the recruiter has a chance to identify the most suitable candidates for the next stage of recruitment, while the candidate gets an opportunity to learn more details about the role they are applying for and about the company.

# **HOW DOES SCREENING LOOK LIKE? WHAT CAN RECRUITERS ASK?**

Let's go back to the very beginning, what happens before the screening takes place? So:

* The recruiter selects the most suitable individuals from all the applications, profiles, and interested candidates (which is why it's crucial to keep your CV/LinkedIn profile up to date).
* Some recruiters proceed directly to screening and contact candidates by phone. However, **at Bright Inventions, we prefer to initiate contact via email to agree on a suitable time for the candidate to talk freely.**
* Appointment scheduled? Great! Let's make the call. Screening (at least at Bright Inventions :) ) usually lasts 20-30 minutes.

# **AND NOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART – WHAT DO RECRUITERS ASK?**

* While it may seem trivial at first glance, for us, it's essential. We ask why you want to change your job, what specifically interests you in the offer, and what motivates you in the current positions.
* We naturally inquire about your experience and knowledge of the technologies/tools required for the specific position.
* The team – it's important for us to know if you prefer smaller or larger teams and your preferences in this area.
* We also ask questions about must-haves, meaning what is important to you in a new workplace, what you want to find, and what you want to avoid - simple yet crucial questions. If there are any aspects that the candidate wants to avoid in their future work environment, it's worth clarifying these issues.
* Foreign languages – especially English. We ask about your proficiency in English, your ability to communicate fluently, and your willingness to work in English. There are also questions to assess your communication skills in this language.
* We would like to know your financial expectations, availability, and preferences regarding the work model (remote or hybrid).
* Naturally, screening is not just about questions. We also take the opportunity to talk about the role, who and why we are looking for, what a candidate can expect from us, the clients, and the projects they will most likely be involved in. **It's crucial for the candidate to have as many details about the role as possible before deciding to participate in the recruitment process.**

# **CAN CANDIDATES PREPARE FOR SCREENING? IF SO, HOW?**

It's worth preparing an appropriate place for the conversation before the screening. Avoid talking to the recruiter while on the bus, cooking dinner, or doing shopping. **Find a quiet place where you can speak freely, without distractions and background noise.**

Familiarize yourself with the company you are applying to, the job posting, and consider relevant questions to ask. If needed, write down all your questions on a piece of paper to ask the recruiter.

# **WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD YOU ASK THE RECRUITER DURING THE CONVERSATION?**

There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. What you want to ask depends on your preferences. However, remember to address the most important aspects during the conversation. The most common questions candidates ask are about working hours, financial compensation, potential tasks, team size, core values [(check what we appreciate at Bright Inventions)](https://brightinventions.pl/about-us/#core-values), questions related to the company's culture, profile and potential project itself, and more. **Of course, there might be other extra aspects you want to mention. Don't be afraid to ask. Getting answers to your pressing questions will help you assess whether the role you're discussing with the recruiter is really what you're looking for.**

# **WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SCREENING?**

After the screening, the recruiter conducts further evaluations. They assess how the conversations went, what the candidates' expectations are, and their English language skills. Based on this information, they select individuals who are invited to the next stage of recruitment and provide them with feedback. 

**Selected candidates are invited to the next stage of recruitment, which, at Bright Inventions, is a technical and non-technical interview. We always strive to justify our decision and [provide our candidates with feedback](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/the-importance-of-feedback-in-bright-recruitment-process/) regardless of the final result.**
