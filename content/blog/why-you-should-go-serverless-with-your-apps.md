**Let’s explore the benefits of serverless computing and why it may be the best option for your business. Whether you represent a startup or a larger company, you’ll find benefits from serverless computing. Let’s dive in!**

## What is serverless computing?

Serverless computing is a cloud-based computing model that eliminates the need to manage its own server infrastructure. As a result, DevOps Engineers and developers from your company don’t have to maintain physical servers. Instead, the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure and ensures the application is available and scalable to meet demand.

We listed the benefits of serverless separately for startups and larger companies. Some advantages apply to all-size businesses. However, we still should have in mind different perspectives of startups and corporations.

## Benefits of serverless computing for startups

Here are some of the benefits of serverless computing for startups:

### Reduced Costs

Startups typically have limited budgets, and serverless computing can help them reduce costs associated with infrastructure management. With serverless computing, **startups can pay for only the resources they use**, rather than having to invest in and manage their own servers and data centers. This can help startups **save money on hardware, maintenance, and personnel costs**.

### Better cost predictability

Since businesses only pay for the computing resources they use, they can more **easily predict and control their costs**. This can help them avoid unexpected expenses and optimize their resource usage.

### Scalability

Startups need to be able to quickly and easily scale their applications as they grow. With serverless computing, startups can **easily scale their applications up or down in response to changes in demand** without having to worry about managing infrastructure.

### Improving app security

Serverless computing providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer a **range of security features, such as automatic software updates, encryption, and network isolation**. By offloading security responsibilities to the serverless computing provider, businesses can focus on other critical aspects of their operations while still following security best practices for their applications and data.
