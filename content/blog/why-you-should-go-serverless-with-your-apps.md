**Let’s explore the benefits of serverless computing and why it may be the best option for your business. Whether you represent a startup or a larger company, you’ll find benefits from serverless computing. Let’s dive in!**

## What is serverless computing?

Serverless computing is a cloud-based computing model that eliminates the need to manage its own server infrastructure.

Instead, the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure and ensures the application is available and scalable to meet demand.

We listed the benefits of serverless separately for startups and larger companies. Some advantages apply to all-size businesses. However, we still should have in mind different perspectives of startups and corporations.
