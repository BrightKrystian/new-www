## My road to software tester job in numbers:

* 12 months (from August 2019 to August 2020)
* 1-2 hours of learning a day
* 1 postgraduate studies
* 10+ online courses
* 1 ISTQB exam
* 3 months of seeking my first job
* 50+ sent CVs
* 1 interview

## Before software testing career

Prior to becoming Software Tester (or QA Specialist as we call the job at Bright Inventions), I was a Product Engineer. I actually first studied Construction Chemicals but I switched to Material Engineering. After graduating from college I was working as a Product Engineer at a huge Polish EMS provider. I had no associations with the software world but I was working on a daily basis with tools like Jira and Confluence which obviously was very helpful when I decided to move to IT.

## Why did I actually want to become a software tester?

That was summer 2019. At some point, the company I worked in wanted to improve the existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP system) so I started to work with software developers on that. My job was to make sure that the system would meet our requirements. Being a part of this process became quite fascinating to me. I was doing something like approval tests. One time I talked about it to my friend who is a software developer and she told me that I was doing in some way a tester job. I was eager to explore that area of expertise.

I started to learn software testing. It took me around 9 hours a week to study. I still had a full-time job during that time. I was also in the middle of moving to another apartment and had lots of dance workouts during a week. So a lot was going out then. I just want to show you that you can make it without giving up on your other duties and interests. üôÇ

## Steps I have taken to become a Software Tester / QA Specialist

![steps to become a software tester](/images/steps_to_become_software_tester.png)

### 1. Starting from Python course

My very first step was doing a Python course at [edx.org](https://www.edx.org) which is a learning platform that I truly recommend. I started by learning Python to simply check if the software development would really interest me.

### 2. Reading blogs about software testing

At that point, I started to be a regular reader of [a Polish blog by Piotr Wicherski](https://pwicherski.gitbook.io/testowanie-oprogramowania/autor). For me, that is a massive pack of information about quality assurance.

I also joined a couple of newsletters about QA and follow news from other blogs such as:

[Software Testing Weekly](https://softwaretestingweekly.com)

### 3. Wait, it is too much. How to get it all together?

I got quickly overwhelmed by the number of information I needed to comprehend. I didn‚Äôt know how to start, what I should learn, and in what order. Then my friend, who is a software tester, recommended me to go to postgraduate studies to get a structured plan of my learning.

### 4. Signing up for the postgraduate studies and preparing for the ISTQB exam

I started my one-year postgraduate studies in Software Testing at the WSB University in Gda≈Ñsk. The first semester was all about getting ready for the ISTQB exam. ISTQB syllabus was my ‚Äúbedtime story‚Äù. I read it every day. It wasn't only about reading, there was lots of googling involved in the process. üòâ  I had to check out lots of terms from the book. It was the hard work with the syllabus to really understand what it is all about. 

The studies at WSB University were useful because my lecturers were software testers who do that job on a daily basis. So I could really understand the daily challenges that go with the work in IT.

### 5. Joining Facebook groups

Obviously, right after applying to college, I joined a couple of Polish Facebook groups that touched on learning software testing. Quickly my Facebook feed became full of tips and tester stories. These are Facebook groups I definitely recommend:

[Tester oprogramowania - wsparcie na starcie](https://www.facebook.com/groups/testeroprogramowania)

[ISTQB - egzaminy, pytania, testy](https://www.facebook.com/groups/194288250951242)

[Testowanie oprogramowania](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TestowanieOprogramowania)

### 6. Getting friendly with the console

Back then I was also focusing on learning Linux and basic commands and ways of using the console. 

### 7. Exploring platforms for testers-to-be

I spent lots of my time at [checkio.org](https://checkio.org). That is another website I really recommend. Checkio is a learning platform that teaches you programming. Yet, it involves gamification. You solve issues and then unlock other challenges. That was really fun and lots of learning at the same time. Another great platform is [exercism.org](https://exercism.org) which also gives many opportunities to learn various programming languages.

I also dove into [mrbuggy.pl](http://mrbuggy.pl) - the Polish app testing platform that was recommended to me by my college professors. It gave me the opportunity to look for bugs in 7 different applications. A very useful tool to learn.

### 8. Writing test cases

Back then I was also learning how to write test cases. My main problem was to write them shorter and more compactly. That was something I had to work hard on.
