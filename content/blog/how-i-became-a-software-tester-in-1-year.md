## My road to software tester job in numbers:

* 12 months (from August 2019 to August 2020)
* 1-2 hours of learning a day
* 1 postgraduate studies
* 10+ online courses
* 1 ISTQB exam
* 3 months of seeking my first job
* 50+ sent CVs
* 1 interview

## Before software testing career

Prior to becoming Software Tester (or QA Specialist as we call the job at Bright Inventions), I was a Product Engineer. I actually first studied Construction Chemicals but I switched to Material Engineering. After graduating from college I was working as a Product Engineer at a huge Polish EMS provider. I had no associations with the software world but I was working on a daily basis with tools like Jira and Confluence which obviously was very helpful when I decided to move to IT.

## Why did I actually want to become a software tester?

That was summer 2019. At some point, the company I worked in wanted to improve the existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP system) so I started to work with software developers on that. My job was to make sure that the system would meet our requirements. Being a part of this process became quite fascinating to me. I was doing something like approval tests. One time I talked about it to my friend who is a software developer and she told me that I was doing in some way a tester job. I was eager to explore that area of expertise.
