## My road to software tester job in numbers:

* 12 months (from August 2019 to August 2020)
* 1-2 hours of learning a day
* 1 postgraduate studies
* 10+ online courses
* 1 ISTQB exam
* 3 months of seeking my first job
* 50+ sent CVs
* 1 interview

## Before software testing career

Prior to becoming Software Tester (or QA Specialist as we call the job at Bright Inventions), I was a Product Engineer. I actually first studied Construction Chemicals but I switched to Material Engineering. After graduating from college I was working as a Product Engineer at a huge Polish EMS provider. I had no associations with the software world but I was working on a daily basis with tools like Jira and Confluence which obviously was very helpful when I decided to move to IT.

## Why did I actually want to become a software tester?

That was summer 2019. At some point, the company I worked in wanted to improve the existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP system) so I started to work with software developers on that. My job was to make sure that the system would meet our requirements. Being a part of this process became quite fascinating to me. I was doing something like approval tests. One time I talked about it to my friend who is a software developer and she told me that I was doing in some way a tester job. I was eager to explore that area of expertise.

I started to learn software testing. It took me around 9 hours a week to study. I still had a full-time job during that time. I was also in the middle of moving to another apartment and had lots of dance workouts during a week. So a lot was going out then. I just want to show you that you can make it without giving up on your other duties and interests. ðŸ™‚

## Steps I have taken to become a Software Tester / QA Specialist

![steps to become a software tester](/images/steps_to_become_software_tester.png)

### 1. Starting from Python course

My very first step was doing a Python course at [edx.org](https://www.edx.org) which is a learning platform that I truly recommend. I started by learning Python to simply check if the software development would really interest me.

### 2. Reading blogs about software testing

At that point, I started to be a regular reader of [a Polish blog by Piotr Wicherski](https://pwicherski.gitbook.io/testowanie-oprogramowania/autor). For me, that is a massive pack of information about quality assurance.

I also joined a couple of newsletters about QA and follow news from other blogs such as:

### 3. Wait, it is too much. How to get it all together?

I got quickly overwhelmed by the number of information I needed to comprehend. I didnâ€™t know how to start, what I should learn, and in what order. Then my friend, who is a software tester, recommended me to go to postgraduate studies to get a structured plan of my learning.
