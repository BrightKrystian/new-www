## Digital transformation for the logistics industry

Digital transformation refers to the implementation of technology to improve various aspects of an organization's operations, business processes, products, services, and customer experiences. Moving into digital with your company documents, processes and data can help to speed up daily operations, secure fragile information and analyze the data to make more business-oriented decisions.

### There are two typical ways to digitalize your company operations:

* You can look for available on the market digital software tools (off-the-shelf software).
* Or hire a software agency to build a customized solution just for you.

## When you should build your own customized solution for logistics

For some companies, off-the-shelf software will be perfectly fine. In some cases, it won’t be enough though. So, when should you consider building something unique for your company?

* When you are a large organization that requires a multifunctional platform to meet the diverse needs of various departments and stakeholders.
* When you have tested other solutions and identified missing features that are crucial for your operations.
* When you have the financial resources, and development capabilities (internal or outsourced) to build something completely suited for your company’s needs.
