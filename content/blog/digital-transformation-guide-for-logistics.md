## Digital transformation for the logistics industry

Digital transformation refers to the implementation of technology to improve various aspects of an organization's operations, business processes, products, services, and customer experiences. Moving into digital with your company documents, processes and data can help to speed up daily operations, secure fragile information and analyze the data to make more business-oriented decisions.

### There are two typical ways to digitalize your company operations:

* You can look for available on the market digital software tools (off-the-shelf software).
* Or hire a software agency to build a customized solution just for you.
