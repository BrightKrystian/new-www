## What were your software development beginnings?

I studied Electronics and Communication at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology for my Bachelorâ€™s degree. Then I studied Informatics for my Master's. My first IT experience was deeply connected with the fact that I lived in student dorms in GdaÅ„sk. **I joined the [Students' Campus Computer Network](https://pg.edu.pl/en/sccn) (SKOS) that managed the whole internet infrastructure in the residence hall of the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology**.

SKOS took care of every aspect of providing dorms residents with the internet including managing servers, building websites, firewalls, and more. It was a huge initiative. The University was the official administrator of the network but in fact, it was the students' job to take care of it on a daily basis. **At a peak moment, we had over 3000 users while the SKOS team consisted of around 20 people**. So that was a lot of work and a huge responsibility. Losing internet connections in a dorm â€“ who would like that to happen? ðŸ˜‰

After that, I got my first internship at a software development company. **I was working on a system for public administration which enabled exporting PDF printouts**. I was mostly writing in SQL there. 

Then, I joined the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology as a regular employee. **I worked on a platform that was a virtual dean's office**. Thanks to this system students could for example apply for scholarships online. Everything I did there was built in Java. 

## Network administration, SQL, and Javaâ€¦ One could be surprised that you are a Senior Frontend Developer at Bright.

I get that confusion. ðŸ™‚ However, after a couple of years, I left my job at the university and joined a software development company where I worked as a full-stack. During that time I had a chance to work on different projects and develop various skills. 

Firstly, I worked as a fullstack on a solution built for a client from the shipping industry. **I wrote the backend in Java and the frontend in JavaScript**. It was my first encounter with the frontend. 

Then, I worked on frontend for another client representing the maritime transport industry. After that, I worked for a Norwegian client mostly developing the backend. I guess I was flexible and always eager to check out every aspect of software development. 

Then I left my job to travel for a couple of months and when I got back I knew **I wanted to specialize only in one side of software development**. Bright Inventions was seeking a frontend developer so I applied. **My girlfriend used to work at Bright and recommended this place to me**. Thanks to her I knew that the atmosphere within the team was more than positive. Another crucial factor for me was that this is a small company. I didnâ€™t want to work in a large organization. And that is why I became a frontend developer at Bright Inventions.
