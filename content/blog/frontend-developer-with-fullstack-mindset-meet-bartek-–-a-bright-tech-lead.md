**Java, SQL, TypeScript, server administration â€“ he has done it all. This is the story of Bartek, a Tech Lead of the frontend team at Bright Inventions. What does it mean to be a tech leader? What are his daily challenges? What did he discover trekking in the Himalayas? Letâ€™s talk to Bartek.**

## What were your software development beginnings?

I studied Electronics and Communication at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology for my Bachelorâ€™s degree. Then I studied Informatics for my Master's. My first IT experience was deeply connected with the fact that I lived in student dorms in GdaÅ„sk. **I joined the [Students' Campus Computer Network](https://pg.edu.pl/en/sccn) (SKOS) that managed the whole internet infrastructure in the residence hall of the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology**.

SKOS took care of every aspect of providing dorms residents with the internet including managing servers, building websites, firewalls, and more. It was a huge initiative. The University was the official administrator of the network but in fact, it was the students' job to take care of it on a daily basis. **At a peak moment, we had over 3000 users while the SKOS team consisted of around 20 people**. So that was a lot of work and a huge responsibility. Losing internet connections in a dorm â€“ who would like that to happen? ðŸ˜‰

After that, I got my first internship at a software development company. **I was working on a system for public administration which enabled exporting PDF printouts**. I was mostly writing in SQL there. 

Then, I joined the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology as a regular employee. **I worked on a platform that was a virtual dean's office**. Thanks to this system students could for example apply for scholarships online. Everything I did there was built in Java. 

## Network administration, SQL, and Javaâ€¦ One could be surprised that you are a Senior Frontend Developer at Bright.

I get that confusion. ðŸ™‚ However, after a couple of years, I left my job at the university and joined a software development company where I worked as a full-stack. During that time I had a chance to work on different projects and develop various skills. 

Firstly, I worked as a fullstack on a solution built for a client from the shipping industry. **I wrote the backend in Java and the frontend in JavaScript**. It was my first encounter with the frontend. 

Then, I worked on frontend for another client representing the maritime transport industry. After that, I worked for a Norwegian client mostly developing the backend. I guess I was flexible and always eager to check out every aspect of software development. 

Then I left my job to travel for a couple of months and when I got back I knew **I wanted to specialize only in one side of software development**. Bright Inventions was seeking a frontend developer so I applied. **My girlfriend used to work at Bright and recommended this place to me**. Thanks to her I knew that the atmosphere within the team was more than positive. Another crucial factor for me was that this is a small company. I didnâ€™t want to work in a large organization. And that is why I became a frontend developer at Bright Inventions.

## And now you are a Tech Lead at Bright. How did that happen?

What can I say? I submitted my application and it was reviewed positively. ðŸ˜‰  **When the opportunity to become a Tech Lead occurred I felt that I could do it**. I had over 5 years of software development experience. I was a frontend developer with the longest practice at Bright and I knew the project. The last part could have been crucial here. **It was a key moment for our client â€“ Just Eat POS â€“ which was in the middle of a transition from a startup to a global ePOS services provider**. 

It is funny because when I came to Bright there was only one frontend team which included me and another programmer that worked on this solution. Right now the client has 3 separate frontend teams. So my knowledge about the project and its processes was essential.

## What does your work as a Tech Lead look like?

Being a tech lead involves looking at a project from a greater perspective. I have to be able to coordinate the life of this project. Just Eat POS system is a complex project, so I cannot be in charge of every decision. Thus **I trust developers to make some decisions but at the same time, I am of assistance to them**, if they need me to discuss any problem. 

Also, I spend some time on code reviewing and analyzing how to solve some issues. **I also take part in various team discussions about choosing libraries and tools**. As a tech lead, I code less but at the same time, I cannot become rusty about it. **I need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, tools, and updates**. And that requires time.

Apart from that, **I am in touch with the product manager to offer recommendations** when there are some business issues to resolve. Then, we together try to find the best solution with the technology we use. 

This is how my work looks as a Tech Leader, in nutshell. ðŸ™‚

## What is the most challenging about a tech lead role?

There are two main challenges I experience on a daily basis. 

First of all, it is **time management**. You have to work hard on organizing your time so you have it for your team. When you are a tech lead, it is not about you anymore. You work closely with your team, a product manager, and other client representatives who expect you to contribute. So I need to manage my time in a way that I can offer my support whenever it is needed. Apart from that, I still need to find time to work on the technical aspects and write some code. ðŸ˜‰  It is not easy to manage it all.
