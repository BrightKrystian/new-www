**In this little tutorial, I am going to show you how to turn Drools rule engine into a practical form of a deployable expert system. I will show you how to make your very own scoring service â€“ like in the banks... well, almost. ðŸ˜‰ Of course, it will not be ready for production but it should give you enough fuel for your imagination to let you sketch your own solution.**
