**Marketers have ideas, targets, analytics tools, and a hunger for leads. Yet, we sometimes need developers to help us achieve our goals. The most common cooperation between a developer and a marketer happens while building a brand website and landing pages. Based on my daily professional relations with developers I listed tips for effective collaboration between marketing specialists and software engineers.**

## Start by choosing the right tool for daily communication

**Emails won’t work**. I hope it’s not a shock to you. **You need a task management tool**. It’s great that both sides choose the tool that works for them. You can go for **Trello, Asana or Jira**. It’s reasonable to choose a tool that both sides have already known. Frankly, far away from emails and you’ll have a good start.

Also, setting up a common **chat channel would be useful**. Whatever is most preferably within your organization: **Slack, Teams or Discuss**. Chat channels will be useful for emergency situations.

## Don’t be afraid of questions

Probably, **you will hear lots of questions from developers**. They can be tricky. Truly listen and then answer. I sometimes made the mistake of not really listening. **I was asked what I wanted to achieve. However, I was describing the feature I expected to be built**. That wasn’t the question. I didn’t understand that difference at first. ;) Still struggle with that sometimes.

It’s **a good sign when developers ask questions**! They usually do it to understand your goal. Then they can recommend the most suitable tech solution to achieve it. Remember that **the feature is just the means to an end**. It’s not the goal itself. **Help developers understand the bigger picture** and you should quickly see better results of the cooperation.

## Feel free to ask questions

**If you hear some tech jargon, don’t get intimidated**. Every industry has its language, and marketing specialists have it as well. Simply ask to explain unknown terms more plainly. 

Also, if you hear that something cannot be done, don’t take “no” for an answer. **Ask why**. Maybe you can work it out another way.

## Learn how to describe a task

I am not an expert like the project managers from my team.

Nevertheless, I will write my **approach to describe the tasks:**

* **Start with the goal** you want to achieve.
* Then **list all the elements** that you expect to be built to achieve that goal.
* Include links to the product designer’s **mockups** if necessary.
* Be **specific and concise**. 
* **Provide a benchmark** to visualize your requirements if possible.
