## What is app performance monitoring and what does it bring to the HealthTech table

Performance monitoring involves regularly checking the "vital signs" of your application to keep an eye on its performance, which is especially crucial as the number of users increases. Every company with a growing product faces the challenge of scaling its infrastructure in line with the increasing number of users. Performance monitoring is a great tool to handle this challenge proactively.

### Example of performing monitoring use case in eHealth

Imagine an app designed to remind your users about taking medication or joining a video consultation with a doctor. However, the notification meant to prompt these actions isn't sent. How can you actually realize that the notifications don't work? It's difficult to notice when something doesn't happen. Yet, with app performance monitoring, you can track every feature, including sending notifications. This way, you'll quickly know when any part of the app doesn't function as intended.

## The best moment to set up performance monitoring

Ideally, you should establish basic performance monitoring before launching your product to measure key metrics and verify that your solution functions correctly. Unfortunately, performance monitoring often becomes a tool companies turn to only after experiencing performance issues, especially those related to an increasing number of users. 

By this point, it might be too late to restore trust among your end-users who might have been frustrated by the app’s performance issues. Starting early with performance monitoring can help you prevent such situations by identifying and addressing potential issues before they impact the user experience.
