**Just days before the important MVP launch Kasia found some time to share her thoughts on her professional role and challenges. Check out how strongly Kasia goes by Scrum. Also, read her recipe for successful communication with developers and clients. Here comes the story of Kasia, the Project Manager at Bright Inventions.**

## Like many developers, you studied Computer Science. What made you go on a project management path?

During my studies, I realized that **I mostly enjoyed classes regarding project management and business perspective** in software development. Especially classes regarding Requirement Engineering. 

Also, I‚Äôve always liked to manage. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a natural leader, but I used to jump into that role when no one else wanted to. **PM work was intriguing because I always enjoyed having control and responsibility** for something. That‚Äôs why managing a development process felt so appalling to me.

## Have you ever thought of switching to the dev side?

I have been thinking about that from time to time. I still think about switching sides.

## Is that true that you started your IT career here at Bright Inventions?

Yes, **[Kasia ≈Åukasewicz](/about-us/kasia/) who was my academic teacher at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology, asked if I would be interested in joining the company**. It was right before graduating the college. I guess I would have become a programmer if she hadn‚Äôt offered me that opportunity.

I‚Äôve always thought that you had to be a developer for a few years before you went on the PM path. Obviously, having tech experience is helpful, but starting like me from a PM job is possible. 

Naturally, when I think about that times I sometimes cannot believe how lost I was at the beginning. üòâNevertheless, I guess everyone has a difficult start and has to learn so much. Kasia‚Äôs support was crucial to me. **I started by joining the project she was managing to observe and learn**. I‚Äôm glad that I didn‚Äôt get my own project from day one because academic knowledge is not such a big support in real life. 

Yet later **when I started managing the project on my own I felt that I also got so much freedom and trust**. Naturally, with trust and freedom came responsibility. However, I still could always go to Kasia for advice. It was up to me, though. No one controlled me, everyone at Bright Inventions trusted me and was for me if needed.

## Every organization has its own version of the PM role. How would you portray PM‚Äôs role at Bright Inventions?

The Project Manager at Bright Inventions doesn‚Äôt play a typical scrum master role. I don‚Äôt only observe the process and offer suggestions. I definitely **work closely with product owners and take part in requirement specifications**. It takes a huge part of my day ‚Äì to discuss what we and our client want to achieve.

<div class="image"><img src="/images/brightteam_skiing.png" alt="skiing" title="undefined"  /> </div>

As a PM your job is to **make the project move on**. You have to ensure that the client is content and that the development team is happy and feels that what they do matters. Obviously, I've never worked anywhere else, so it‚Äôs hard to compare that to other workplaces. Yet I like the fact that **I am truly responsible for the project** and no one higher up the ladder interferes in my work. 

## What are the projects you manage on daily basis?

One of the projects is the **payment instruments distribution system** developed for one of the top global humanitarian agencies. Thanks to this solution the agency team can distribute debit cards (or other payment instruments like sim cards or vouchers) to communities in need.

Our client‚Äôs efforts not only result in helping people in crises but also in supporting the growth of local economies. The cards give beneficiaries the freedom to choose what help they actually need.

The solution is used in a couple of Asian and African countries. The team I work on for that project contains 4 fullstack developers, 2 mobile devs, and 3 software testers. Working on this project is definitely rewarding. **Not every day you get a chance to build tech for humanitarian purposes**. The aspects of helping people and social justice are significant to me. I really feel that we work on something that has greater meaning.

## That's one project. Is there another project you manage?

Another project is a mobile application built for our German client representing the **building and construction industry**. The **app will help clients‚Äô employees and contractors create and store documentation needed at construction sites**. We build native **apps for iOS and Android**. The development team at Bright consists of 4 mobile developers

There are two greatest challenges coming with this project. The first is very technical. End users cannot depend on the internet connection at construction sites. Therefore **most features have to be available offline**. That adds a lot of complexity during defining the requirements phase.

The second is that backend for our app is built by another external company. They are very open to any discussions and suggestions, but it requires additional effort on the coordination side.

We are at a very exciting stage of the project development, **just days before the MVP launch**.
