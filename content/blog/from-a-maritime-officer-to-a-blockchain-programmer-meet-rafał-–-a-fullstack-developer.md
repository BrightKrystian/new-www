**RafaÅ‚ was a maritime officer who decided to settle on a software development land. He learned how to code aboard the ship, having very limited access to the internet. Can you imagine doing that without Stack Overflow? He can! ðŸ˜‰ Check out his road from a navigator to a full-stack developer who specializes in Ethereum blockchain.**

## You were an experienced maritime navigator before you became a software developer. How do you remember those times?

Yes, **I had been a ship navigator for 4 years**. Actually, I wanted to be an airplane pilot but my vision defect disqualified me from pursuing that career. So I started to think about a maritime navigator career. I met their vision requirements. Both jobs are quite similar. Of course, the main difference between piloting an aircraft to a ship is the speed and the fact that you operate in three-dimensional space as a pilot. Everything happens 10 times faster in the plane. However, in terms of navigation, understanding weather conditions, and route planning I could see similarities. Plus, I always enjoyed sailing and had a sailing license so I figured this could be a great career for me. 

So I moved from CzÄ™stochowa to Nothern Poland to study at Gdynia Maritime University. When I graduated and became a navigator everything was so new and exciting at first. After a couple of years, I felt that even though I became an officer I did not see any exciting challenges ahead. Everything became so monotonous and homogeneous. There was nothing new for me to learn there.
