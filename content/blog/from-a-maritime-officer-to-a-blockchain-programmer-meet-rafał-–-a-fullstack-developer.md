**RafaÅ‚ was a maritime officer who decided to settle on a software development land. He learned how to code aboard the ship, having very limited access to the internet. Can you imagine doing that without Stack Overflow? He can! ðŸ˜‰ Check out his road from a navigator to a full-stack developer who specializes in Ethereum blockchain.**

## You were an experienced maritime navigator before you became a software developer. How do you remember those times?

Yes, **I had been a ship navigator for 4 years**. Actually, I wanted to be an airplane pilot but my vision defect disqualified me from pursuing that career. So I started to think about a maritime navigator career. I met their vision requirements. Both jobs are quite similar. Of course, the main difference between piloting an aircraft to a ship is the speed and the fact that you operate in three-dimensional space as a pilot. Everything happens 10 times faster in the plane. However, in terms of navigation, understanding weather conditions, and route planning I could see similarities. Plus, I always enjoyed sailing and had a sailing license so I figured this could be a great career for me. 

So I moved from CzÄ™stochowa to Nothern Poland to study at Gdynia Maritime University. When I graduated and became a navigator everything was so new and exciting at first. After a couple of years, I felt that even though I became an officer I did not see any exciting challenges ahead. Everything became so monotonous and homogeneous. There was nothing new for me to learn there.

Also, I felt that I missed so much being at the sea. During these long contracts, you don't have time for your family, you don't have time to actually live your life. People often think that this line of work gives you lots of opportunities to sightseeing. Yet in reality, I barely step on the land. On most of my contracts, I never left the ship. 

Another aspect is that the world was moving so fast in terms of the new technologies and I felt I was left behind. When I was a student not many people had smartphones with internet access. Then **I started to work on the ships when the whole smartphone revolution started and I felt like I was missing so much**. That was painful because I was very keen on new technologies, loved to operate machines on deck, and felt good at that.  

## That is when you started to work on your move to software development?

Yes. As I said I was always into new technologies. Math, Physics, and Informatics were subjects that I really liked in high school. I learned some C++ then as well. I also passed the Polish Matura exam in Informatics. So I thought that programming could be another chapter for me. 

Many of my high school friends actually were programmers so I contacted one of them and asked him to help me with my career change. He recommended me some books that I brought on board with me for (what turned out to be) my last maritime job ever. Believe it or not but we did not have an access to the internet onboard. We had one computer with an internet connection that could be used by everyone so you could spend on it max 30 minutes a day. So **I read lots of books and wrote some code in my free time and sent it to my colleague via email** for a review. That was how I learned to code. I focused on Java back then.

After that last 3 months-job, I came home and never pursued a maritime career again. In total it took me 5-6 months of learning to get my first software development job. I was going to the interviews. One of them was at Bright inventions but I didnâ€™t get a job here then. ;) I was hired somewhere else. The project I worked on was quite interesting from a business perspective because I worked on a solution for a smart card company. However, in terms of technologies and software processes, there were not many opportunities to grow as a developer. 

Fortunately, 2 months after my interview at Bright, they called me and asked me if I wanted to join them. I said yes.

## You must have sunk deep into the recruiters' memory. Why do you think they called you?

**I think they could see how determined I was** to start my software development career. It was a total change for me, a pivot that I truly accepted with all its advantages and disadvantages. I had a successful career that I decided to cross out. Nevertheless, I was ready for everything to get my first software development job.

I must say that the technical interview at Bright was challenging. Yet, I wasnâ€™t discouraged. I felt that I wanted to work with these people because they were experts who could teach me a lot.

**That was over 5 years ago and my Bright adventure continues**. For me, the crucial thing about working at Bright Inventions is that this is a company with a human touch. Everyone is open and friendly to each other. And your boss is not some evil guy you donâ€™t like as it often is a case in other workplaces.

## What did 4 years in the maritime industry give you? Are there any knowledge and skills you incorporated into your next profession?

Firstly, **I learned responsibility for my actions**. When you are on a shift and are responsible for the whole crew, you quickly understand the gravity of the word responsibility. I was the first officer and most people who have that position are around 25-30 years old. So at a young age, you quickly learn that your actions influence the life and safety of others.

Secondly, **I learned analytical thinking and making decisions under stressful conditions**. Thanks to my maritime career I also knew English very well because it was the lead language used at that job.

Also, this profession gave me an incredible chance to meet and cooperate with people from different countries. **I learned how communication depends on people's customs, backgrounds, and nationalities**. Existing in such a global and diverse community was really special.

I believe that it was one of the reasons why Bright eventually wanted me on board. We work mostly with international clients so having this experience in international communication must have been an advantage of mine.
