**You are a manual tester and you would like to start writing automation tests but you don’t know how to start. You even learn some programming language but what next? How to start writing automation tests? How to choose the right language and framework? Which test should be your first automated one? Here is my guide on how to switch from manual to automation tester.**

## How I started writing UI automation tests

Actually, I wasn’t a manual tester before starting automation tests. I was testing some applications but not in the Software Tester position, so I didn’t know much about test cases, etc. I just bought a book about JavaScript and started learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS from free tutorials like Codecademy or Coursera. I also chose an existing webpage and wrote it from scratch (without JS, just CSS) to practice HTML and CSS. I watched some free videos on YouTube. **I took part in many challenges on platforms like Codewars** to get points and finally, **I wrote some games** like memory or ping-pong to build my GitHub profile. **When I got stuck I just asked my friend, who is a developer, for a hint on how to move on**.

At some point I didn’t know if I had sufficient knowledge and what to do next. It was exactly this time when I started writing tests using WebdriverIO. **The language or tool to learn doesn’t matter much. The most important thing is just to start writing code**. Shortly after that (3 months later) I got a job in which I was writing automation tests from scratch. It was the best practice for me. I understood quickly what flaky tests are, how many tests I should write, etc. With this experience, it was easier to write tests in other frameworks like Cucumber, Cypress, Playwright, etc.

This was my road to writing tests. I didn’t know how to start, I just knew that I could and I would do it. **Now based on my experience I would like to show you how easy it is to start writing automation tests**, especially when you are a Software Tester. 

## When can you start automation testing?

I assume that you have good knowledge about the product which you test manually. Certainly, you wrote some test cases and you know which of them you test more than others. Also, **you are aware which test cases are repeatable and are prone to bugs. These are test cases that could be automated**. So at the beginning, you can start writing a test plan for automation tests including them.
