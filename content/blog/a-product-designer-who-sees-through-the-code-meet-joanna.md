## You started your career in IT & Security Administration. What made you go into Product Design?

While I was at college studying Informatics and Econometrics I realized that programming wasn’t my thing. At the same time, I enjoyed classes about UX. **I wrote my bachelor's thesis about UX. It was a quite practical thesis because I redesigned the University of Gdańsk department website**.

Then I went to post-graduation studies in UX Design/Product Design. At that time I worked as an Information Security Administration Specialist dreaming of a career in product design. **Eventually, I got my first product designer job at Bright Inventions**.

*Joanna described her incredible career journey from IT Administrator to Junior Developer in another blog post. [Read her career transformation story](/blog/how-to-get-first-product-designer-job/)!*

## How do you recall the job interview at Bright Inventions?

Great! Although I was shocked, when I was informed, before the interview, that it would take 2 hours. I thought, "What could we discuss for such a long time?". In the end, it went well because **it was just a friendly, open conversation. It wasn't a typical round of questions**.

## What is your advice to people aspiring to become junior product designers?

Don't give up. **You will probably receive lots of rejections**. It will be frustrating, but you have to get through that phase. **You have to keep pushing, keep developing your portfolio, and redesign the apps you think could work better**. Naturally, you have to stay updated with trends by attending design conferences, workshops, webinars, and so on.

## So what are your sources of product design knowledge?

I follow top designers on LinkedIn and Instagram e.g. [Zander Whitehurst](https://www.instagram.com/zanderwhitehurst/), [Katy](https://www.instagram.com/katy.ba), [Aga Naplocha](https://www.instagram.com/theawwwesomes), as well as the profile of [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.instagram.com/nngux). 

You know how it goes – as soon as you follow some profiles, your feed is quickly full of news, trends, and inspirations in that regard. I also sign up for various UX courses and try to regularly obtain certificates. 

**Books can't be overrated as well. I can recommend books such as:**

* *The Design of Everyday Things* by Donald Arthur Norman
* *[Don't Make Me Think](/blog/5-web-development-rules-from-dont-make-me-think-book/)* by Steve Krug
* *User Experience Team of One* by Leah Buley
* *100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about People* by Susan Weinschenk
* *Grid Systems in Graphic Design* by Josef Müller-Brockmann
* *GIVING A DAMN ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY*, Sheri BYRNE-Haber
* *Build Better Products: A Modern Approach to Building Successful User-Centered Products* by Laura Klein
* Polish: *Badania jako podstawa projektowania user experienc*e by Iga Mościchowska, Barbara Rogoś-Turek

## Figma or Adobe XD… Which one is your favorite and why?

It's **Figma**, for sure! In my view, Adobe has stopped developing as a product. **Figma has surpassed its competitors because they truly focus on implementing user feedback**. Also, Figma has a great community that enriches this product.

I think as well that **Figma makes it easier to collaborate with developers**. However, in my opinion, Figma is more oriented toward UI design and product design. Adobe Apps are in fact better for graphic designers, who make animations and more artistic stuff. So everyone can find something for themselves.

## Do you see the negative impacts of Adobe taking over Figma?

In terms of product development, I haven't seen any major issues. Obviously, **I can see the commercialization and rising prices of Figma**. However, every business wants to earn money. I guess that sooner or later Figma had to transform into a more expensive tool.

## What is your favorite font?

**I have a strong sentiment toward [Roc Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/roc-grotesk)** because I used it to design products with my friends, and it became our brand's cool font. I also appreciate [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) which is Figma’s default font. On my top list, I would include [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) (although it is a little technical) and [Acumin Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin).
