## You started your career in IT & Security Administration. What made you go into Product Design?

While I was at college studying Informatics and Econometrics I realized that programming wasn’t my thing. At the same time, I enjoyed classes about UX. **I wrote my bachelor's thesis about UX. It was a quite practical thesis because I redesigned the University of Gdańsk department website**.

Then I went to post-graduation studies in UX Design/Product Design. At that time I worked as an Information Security Administration Specialist dreaming of a career in product design. **Eventually, I got my first product designer job at Bright Inventions**.

## How do you recall the job interview at Bright Inventions?

Great! Although I was shocked, when I was informed, before the interview, that it would take 2 hours. I thought, "What could we discuss for such a long time?". In the end, it went well because **it was just a friendly, open conversation. It wasn't a typical round of questions**.
