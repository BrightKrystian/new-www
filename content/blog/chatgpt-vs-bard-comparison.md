**Google introduced Bard ‚Äì a rival to ChatGPT. Little do we know about Google's AI chat system. Yet, we can initially compare both AI solutions. The article will be updated. Feel free to bookmark/pocket it for later.**

## Bard vs ChatGPT language models

Bard is powered by [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/). However, ChatGPT is based on [GPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3). What does it mean for us ‚Äì users? Putting aside technology differences, from users' perspective Bard should provide more up-to-date information.

LaMDA üëâ Provides real-time responses and has access to up-to-date information and data.

GPT üëâ Don‚Äôt provide real-time data. Its knowledge doesn‚Äôt go beyond 2021.

For example,

Bard should tell you who won the 2023 Grammy. ChatGPT won‚Äôt give you that information.

## Integration with search engines

Microsoft announced that [Bing will be enhanced with ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/07/microsoft-launches-the-new-bing-with-chatgpt-built-in/). Is it a move that Google was afraid of? Perhaps. The CEO of Google & Alphabet confirmed that [Bard will be integrated with Google's search engine](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1622674382069059591). 

That seems like a powerful advantage to already a giant search engine. Many have tried to overcome Google, but no one succeeded (yet?).

Data from the recent ‚ÄúDigital 2023 Global Overview Report'' shows a clear dominance. However, AI might make the competition exciting for the first time in 20 years.

Adding an AI chat solution to Google seems essential to stay ahead of competitors. However, there might be reasons why Google didn‚Äôt rush into that, even though they definitely worked hard on their own AI chat solution.

According to the promotional material provided by Google, we can assume that Bard will take over a SERP (search engine results page) position zero.

It might make it even harder to organically build your website traffic. And what about advertisers? Where will be their place in this new equation?

Figuring a way that will satisfy advertisers, publishers and generally content creators might be more challenging than building the Bard itself. 

## ChatGPT and Bard prices

A few months after the launch of ChatGPT OpenAI introduced a paid plan. When it comes to Bard - not many people have access to it at the moment. However, assuming that it is going to be a part of our Google search experience, then it might be free(?).

## Last but not least ‚Äì ChatGPT and Bard both make mistakes üòâ

Let‚Äôs start with ChatGPT which is widely used across the globe. Let us show you one example of ChatGPT's problematic response:

Take a look at number 4. Garry Wills didn't write the ‚ÄùEmancipation Proclamation‚Äù. Abraham Lincoln did.

When it comes to Bard not many people had the opportunity to test its ‚Äútruthfulness‚Äù. Yet Google offered help. Thanks to the official promo material we could see that the [bot made mistake](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3209563/googles-chatgpt-rival-bard-gives-wrong-answer-ad-sending-shares-diving). Whether Google wants it or not we can be sure that any data from AI chats should be verified by a human. 

## Using AI in software development

It‚Äôs not something new to include AI in software development. However, products like ChatGPT definitely moved AI to the mainstream and showed globally its potential. We will continue to observe the development of ChatGPT as well as the beginnings of Bard. We will let you know how you could implement it for your business.
