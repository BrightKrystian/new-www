We’ve all been there - you said something wrong, [now you long for yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrgmdOz227I). There was an awkward silence and it felt like a scene from [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/).

The good news is that nobody’s writing our lines to make us look silly - we write them ourselves. And yes, this is the good news. **Communicating well is not a personality trait, it’s a skill and as such it can be trained and improved.** It takes time and attention as with other skills but thankfully you get better at it. In the meantime though, mistakes will be made. Let’s cringe together, reminiscing about some of the not so obvious but universal ones.

## **1. Lack of communication**

In my experience, this is the most common problem and I could stop at it really. There are countless reasons for not communicating something: “*I thought it was obvious*”, “*I was afraid to ask*”, “*I didn’t have time*”, “*I didn’t realise it was important*”. This is why communication is not easy - we prefer to stay mute because it feels easier at the time. **However, even when it seems daunting, it’s so much easier to handle things straight away than to wait for them to escalate.**

There’s usually this feeling **“Maybe they won’t notice, maybe it’s not that important”** - if you get it, it’s a wonderful indication that **indeed, they WILL and yes, it IS**. For starters, YOU did notice that it might be an issue. Think about the most common situations when you struggle to communicate, it will be easier to speak up the next time when you spot them. If it’s usually about the estimations (when you already know you won’t make it in time but say nothing), then next time try to push yourself to talk before the actual deadline apocalypse. I still struggle with this sometimes but realising it’s a problem is already a step forward.  

Another reason might be that you just didn’t pay enough attention to know what and when to say. It happens and it’s ok, unless you spend the whole meeting scrolling through cat memes.
