**With this tutorial, you'll receive step-by-step instructions on how to conduct an internal security audit of your healthcare software, along with a list of dozens of tools to assist you in the process. Most of these tools offer free trials, allowing you to quickly test them and then decide if they're the right asset for your team.**

Can you blame patients? Just visit the TechCrunch healthcare section to see countless stories about data leaks, hacks, and more. Why should patients trust healthcare tech companies with their data? Unfortunately, even if you aim to implement top security practices, you are facing the same mistrust issues as part of the industry. So, how can you build trust among your users? Secure product is the right answer. Letâ€™s discuss security measures you should incorporate in your HealthTech company.

## Audit your software and keep SSDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle)

### Adhering to OWASP best practices

The security bible for many is the set of security checklists OWASP provides. Begin by making sure your software team adheres to OWASP security resources. Methodically progress through every top OWASP checklist and verify with your software team that you have implemented these recommendations.

ðŸ‘‰ [The list of OWASP resources](/blog/top-owasp-resources-to-follow/)

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Static Application Security Testing (SAST), using dedicated SAST tools, will scan your app's code and alert you to any vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections, outdated algorithms, or strings that could be potential passwords.

## Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

DAST tools often provide the ability to proxy requests, record them, tamper with them, replay them, inject parameters, build a site map by crawling, and more.

## Track dependencies

Dependency tracking tools assist in identifying outdated or vulnerable dependencies in our code e.g. libraries, frameworks, plugins, or other software modules that a project relies on to function. Track dependencies tools support effective code modernization by automatically highlighting places that should be updated.

## Detect secret leaks

Detecting secret leaks involves identifying instances where sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, secret tokens, or private keys, have been unintentionally exposed in places they shouldn't be like public repositories, open documentation, or log files. There are tools and practices designed to prevent and detect these leaks.

## Infrastructure Reconnaissance

Infrastructure reconnaissance tools allow businesses to scan their infrastructure for vulnerabilities, including outdated software versions, open ports, and misconfigured security headers.
