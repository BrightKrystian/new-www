**For most of his life, Cezary was passionate about gymnastics. He even became an acrobatic instructor for kids. Then he got a professional acrobatic role in a musical play! Eventually, he decided to self-learn programming and said goodbye to the gymnastics world. Why? Check out the amazing story of Cezary. Also, meet his lovely dog Tola.**

## Is it true that you had been an acrobatic instructor before you became a programmer?

Yes. Doing sports has always been a crucial part of my life. During middle school (Polish Gimnazjum), I joined the rowing team. Also, I was practicing gymnastics. The latter was more attractive to me. I was doing both for years but at the end of high school, I decided to fully commit to gymnastics.

After graduating from high school I went to Civil Engineering studies but I didnâ€™t really enjoy them so I resigned and went to the Gdansk University Of Physical Education and Sport. **I was focused on practicing gymnastics**. Naturally, I couldnâ€™t be a pro because I started that adventure when I was 12, and you should start practicing gymnastics when turning 6. 

Eventually, **I became an acrobatic instructor for kids**. I also auditioned for the acrobatic dancer role at the Music Theater in Gdynia. I got a role with some of my friends. So **I was an acrobatic dancer in the Notre Dame De Paris show**. That was pretty cool.

However, I felt that my body had enough of the intensive training routine. I couldnâ€™t do it forever. I felt I needed to move on and then I decided to become a programmer.

## You are a self-taught developer. Tell us more about your process.

I came up with the idea to learn software development after I graduated from college and had that job at the theater. My best friend and my brother planned to be software developers so I thought I could try that, too. Ironically some years ago, one of the reasons why I chose to study Civil Engineering was not to sit by my desk 8 hours a day. Look how it all turned out. ðŸ˜‰ 

When I decided to learn programming, my girlfriend was the only person who knew about it. I was learning from morning hours to afternoon and then I was going to the theatrical rehearsals.
