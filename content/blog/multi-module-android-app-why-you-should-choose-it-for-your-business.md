**Multi-module app architecture is not something that your users will see. However, app owners will quickly discover the benefits. If you are about to decide on the architecture of your Android solution, consider choosing a multi-module. Here are the top business advantages of multi-module Android apps.**

## Multi-module vs. single-module applications

Let’s start with the basics. What multi-module-apps are and how they are different from single-module solutions?

<div class="important-info"><h2>What is a multi-module approach?</h2><div>It is a modern way to design Android applications’ architecture. Instead of a single-module app, the codebase in multi-module apps isn’t one large monolith. It’s the opposite, it contains separated modules with code.</div></div>

If you plan to build an Android mobile app, you should consider that option with your development team. Why? **Based on our experience in building multi-module apps we listed the advantages of this solution.**

## Advantages of multi-module applications

There are a couple of advantages of multi-module apps:

### Effective development process

Building and testing time might decrease because developers can work only with one module of code. It might also result in **speeding up the whole development process** and ultimately **saving costs**.

### Clarity

Small chunks of code are **easier to understand and eventually work with**. Divided into a reasonable abstraction could be very useful during onboarding. New members of the development team can faster understand the code and start to work with it.

### Interoperability & scalability

Multi-module apps are a **great base for future interoperabilities and integrations** with, for example, IoT, printers, payment terminals, or external software integrations. **You are more flexible to add other features**. Even if you don’t plan that at this point, you leave yourself an option to take care of that, perhaps after the [MVP](/our-areas/mvp-development/) launch.

### Better customization

If you plan to sell a **solution that could be adjusted to different types of customers** (customized UI, different basic features), then it is easier to offer that with multi-module architecture. For instance, you offer a customer support tool and you want to adjust it to the needs of companies representing different industries. A multi-module architecture will help you be more flexible in that regard.

## When you should consider multi-module architecture:

Choosing multi-modules isn’t a perfect solution for everyone. All comes down to the development stage you are in:

* When you are about to start the development process, then you can freely decide to build your architecture in that way. 
* If you already have developed and launched a product, it might be difficult to change the architecture at this point. It will be beneficial for your business in the long term, however not every business can afford to spend funds for refactoring.

## Example of a multi-module app

Check out the actual case study – a [multi-module application for retail](/projects/system-for-restaurants-mobile) that we developed for Just Eat.
