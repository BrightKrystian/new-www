## What are SAST Tools?

These are the tools used for **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**. SAST tools scan your app’s code and notify you about any vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, outdated algorithms, or strings with possible passwords.

## SAST tools to consider

Here are 3 examples of SAST tools that are worth consideration. They offer free trials so you can check them easily and verify their potential on your own.

[Snyk](https://snyk.io/)

* Paid SAST tool, but also has a free version for ~100 scans a month.
* Snyk is a powerful tool that can be used as a plugin for your favorite IDE for local development.
* Scans code security, gives the severity of issues and suggests fixes.
* Also scans dependencies and gives an advisor score for the package.
* The easy onboarding process, with the ability to scan your CI/CD and add new team members to your project.

[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev)

* Another paid SAST tool that is available as SaaS for free for teams of up to 20 persons.
* Onboarding is easy and has the option to use the scanner with CI/CD pipeline and use the Web dashboard.
* Semgrep can also be used as an Open Source tool without limits and has a built-in GitLab Security Scanner.

[SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/)

* It is available as a free and paid version, with Sonarlint being the free IDE extension for analyzing projects.
* The rules set is quite limited without a local SonarQube server or SonarQube cloud.
* To enjoy free linting with extended rules set, download the SonarQube Community Edition and run a server locally.
* Configuring the server can be more cumbersome than Snyk, but there is no limit to the number of scans.
* Can be configured for your team and used for managing issues together.

For security purposes, it is suggested to use Snyk for local development, Semgrep for CI/CD if your team is small, and SonarQube for CI/CD scans as a self-hosted Community Edition if your team is bigger.
