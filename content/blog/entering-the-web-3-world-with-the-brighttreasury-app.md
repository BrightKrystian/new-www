**BrightTreasury app helps you get cryptocurrency to develop your ideas and contribute to communities built around Web3 ideas. To receive the funds you don’t have to be a blockchain expert. Yet, at some point in this journey, you should set up your Web3 identity. Find out more about a Web3 account.**

## What is the BrighTreasury application?

[BrightTreasury](https://treasury.bright.dev?utm_source=brightinventions_blog&utm_medium=link_article&utm_campaign=web3account&utm_id=content_marketing) is a web application that makes it easier to contribute to the community and receive funds for ideas developing Web3. You don't have to be a developer to use this app. The goal is to attract professionals who may not be [substrate blockchain developers](/our-areas/blockchain) but still could contribute in a significant way. These could be, for example, graphic designers, marketing specialists, or filmmakers who could get funds to promote Kusama and Polkadot communities' contributions to Web3.

The basic flow to get funds via BrightTreasury consists of these steps:

**Submit an Idea**

Anyone can submit an idea on the BrightTreasury app in a couple of minutes.

**Discuss your idea**

This step is crucial. Wait for the feedback from the community to find out if your idea has a chance to be approved.

**Turn the idea into a proposal**

If you feel that your idea has a chance to receive funds, you can turn it into a proposal. Then, the community can vote on your solution. 

**Get the finals decision about the treasury grant**

If your proposal is approved, you will receive the cryptocurrency (Polkadot $DOT or Kusama $KSM) to make it happen.

## Login options on BrightTreasury

While developing the app we had to have in mind that it is not only for [substrate blockchain enthusiasts](/blog/5-benefits-of-substrate-blockchain/). We felt that flexibility was the key. Thus, to help you enter this world we enabled two sign-up options:

1. Traditional sign-up and log in by entering a username, email address, and password – a friendly option for non-blockchain experts.
2. Sign-up and log in through your Web3 address – an option well known by every Web3 enthusiast.

As the first option is quite obvious, let's dive into the latter.
