## What is the BrighTreasury application?

[BrightTreasury](https://treasury.bright.dev?utm_source=brightinventions_blog&utm_medium=link_article&utm_campaign=web3account&utm_id=content_marketing) is a web application that makes it easier to contribute to the community and receive funds for ideas developing Web3. You don't have to be a developer to use this app. The goal is to attract professionals who may not be [substrate blockchain developers](/our-areas/blockchain) but still could contribute in a significant way. These could be, for example, graphic designers, marketing specialists, or filmmakers who could get funds to promote Kusama and Polkadot communities' contributions to Web3.
