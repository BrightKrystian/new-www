## Youâ€™re a Civil Engineer by profession. Why did you change your career to software development?

Because Iâ€™ve found out that **software development fits my character and personality even more**.

In my school times, I had a great math teacher, who awoke my passion for mathematical riddles and solving complex tasks. Whatâ€™s important â€“ getting joy and satisfaction out of it.

In programming, **I can see that something Iâ€™ve implemented works fine as code and does its job in real life**. Thatâ€™s truly rewarding. The software industry is evolving so quickly that you must work hard to keep up. By choosing it I knew I would constantly develop too.

What I really like about it, is that **by working as a software developer you get to know many other industries too** â€“ from the restaurant business to the space industry. In IT there is no place for boredom.

## Have you ever regretted spending years on getting a Civil Engineering degree?

Never. I believe that the path I made to become a software developer was the way it was supposed to be. Moreover, **studying civil engineering had hardened me** â€“ especially all those sleepless nights spent on my laptop working on projects. ðŸ™‚

## You are a fullstack. Did you start from the backend or frontend?

I started my career as a **backend developer**. I first worked with **Java**. Then I got a chance at work to develop as a frontend dev as well. So I learned **TypeScript and Angular**. I realized that **I prefer to look at software holistically**. I like to know what happens on both sides.
