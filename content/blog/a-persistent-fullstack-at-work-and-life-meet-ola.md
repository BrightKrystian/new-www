**Ola has been a programmer for over 4 years, starting her career with Java. She sets goals and always reaches them. She has practiced swimming and played the transverse flute most of her life. Do you want to know how she does it? Read the interview.**

## You’re a Civil Engineer by profession. Why did you change your career to software development?

Because I’ve found out that **software development fits my character and personality even more**.

In my school times, I had a great math teacher, who awoke my passion for mathematical riddles and solving complex tasks. What’s important – getting joy and satisfaction out of it.

In programming, **I can see that something I’ve implemented works fine as code and does its job in real life**. That’s truly rewarding. The software industry is evolving so quickly that you must work hard to keep up. By choosing it I knew I would constantly develop too.

What I really like about it, is that **by working as a software developer you get to know many other industries too** – from the restaurant business to the space industry. In IT there is no place for boredom.

## Have you ever regretted spending years on getting a Civil Engineering degree?

Never. I believe that the path I made to become a software developer was the way it was supposed to be. Moreover, **studying civil engineering had hardened me** – especially all those sleepless nights spent on my laptop working on projects. 🙂

## You are a fullstack. Did you start from the backend or frontend?

I started my career as a **backend developer**. I first worked with **Java**. Then I got a chance at work to develop as a frontend dev as well. So I learned **TypeScript and Angular**. I realized that **I prefer to look at software holistically**. I like to know what happens on both sides.

## How did you get at Bright Inventions?

I actually **have heard a lot of great things about Bright Inventions** from [Maja](/about-us/maja/). She works here and has been my friend since middle school. She even sent me a Bright Inventions job offer in 2020 saying “Isn’t that you?”. 😏 In fact, I read the requirements and I really felt like it was written for me.

However, at that time I didn’t feel like changing a job, so I passed the offer to [Maciej](/about-us/maciej-n/), a friend of mine. He applied and joined the team before me. Since then he started to tell me how awesome it was here and that I should join. I got the courage to make a change. **Joining Bright Inventions became my dream that came true in 2021**. 

## Wow. I had no idea. Let the record show that the marketing department didn’t force you to tell this story. ;) And how do you recall your job interview?

Great. I had a job interview with [Michał](/about-us/michal-k/) (mostly), [Piotr](/about-us/piotr/), and [Ula](/about-us/ula/). It’s hard to really call it an interview. **It was like a conversation with other programmers**. I felt that **everyone wanted to get to know me**. This looked totally different compared to my previous interviews. I didn’t feel during the whole meeting (which lasted over 2 hours) that I was being evaluated in any way. Obviously, I had to be, but no one made me feel that I was.

Even if I didn’t know the answer to a question or hadn’t worked with some tools or frameworks, I felt that they didn’t take that against me. I would recommend anyone to attend the interview at Bright Inventions. 😊
