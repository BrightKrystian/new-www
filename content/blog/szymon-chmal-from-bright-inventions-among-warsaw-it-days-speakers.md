Szymon Chmal is a senior frontend developer with a holistic view of software and a mind full of brilliant ideas. Heâ€™s in love with React, but open to new technologies regarding both frontend and backend areas. Technology is for him just a tool used to provide business value to software products he is working on.

## Watch Szymonâ€™s webinars for Warsaw IT Days

Szymon will record two speeches that will be available as VOD for Warsaw IT Daysâ€™ attendees. Both webinars are dedicated to mid and experienced frontend developers. They will be held in Polish.
