**Selecting a tech stack for your MVP should be a well-thought-out process. Every software product is different, so there isn’t one MVP stack cheat sheet for all of them. Let’s go through the most common decision-making factors while choosing technologies and languages for your digital product. Ultimately, check out the list of a typical tech stack for MVP in 2023.**

## Choose only standardized software & tools

Think twice before you agree to develop your MVP using a niche framework or unpopular programming languages and libraries. It may be a sign of a couple of potential issues in the future. 

One of the problems is moving the project to the in-house team or another software company. It will be **challenging to find developers and software agencies that are familiar with unpopular stack**. You would be forced to find experts with some very unpopular skills. That brings **extra costs to the table**.

What’s more, niche tools and solutions usually **don’t have a community built around them**, so there will be not enough materials and docs that would help developers to faster find solutions for tech issues. As a result, it might slow down the development process.

The easiest way to verify the popularity of languages and other tools is by reading the annual [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023). However, **it doesn’t mean that you should just choose the most popular tools/languages on the market**. Yet ensure that the stack you go with is well-known, with lots of resources and documentation that will support your developers.
