**Selecting a tech stack for your MVP should be a well-thought-out process. Every software product is different, so there isn’t one MVP stack cheat sheet for all of them. Let’s go through the most common decision-making factors while choosing technologies and languages for your digital product. Ultimately, check out the list of a typical tech stack for MVP in 2023.**

## Choose only standardized software & tools

Think twice before you agree to develop your MVP using a niche framework or unpopular programming languages and libraries. It may be a sign of a couple of potential issues in the future. 

One of the problems is moving the project to the in-house team or another software company. It will be **challenging to find developers and software agencies that are familiar with unpopular stack**. You would be forced to find experts with some very unpopular skills. That brings **extra costs to the table**.

What’s more, niche tools and solutions usually **don’t have a community built around them**, so there will be not enough materials and docs that would help developers to faster find solutions for tech issues. As a result, it might slow down the development process.

The easiest way to verify the popularity of languages and other tools is by reading the annual [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023). However, **it doesn’t mean that you should just choose the most popular tools/languages on the market**. Yet ensure that the stack you go with is well-known, with lots of resources and documentation that will support your developers.

## Choose a stack that your development team/MVP agency knows

You shouldn't force a tech unknown to your team because it will slow down the MVP process and probably compromise the quality of the software they produce.

You should **take developers' voices into account**. They will be working with the stack you eventually approve, so they should have a chance to at least express their opinion and show you why they recommend one tool over another.

## Don’t blindly follow trends. Choose the stack that suits your product

When you build an MVP from scratch, there is a **huge temptation to use new trendy solutions**. For example, Apple’s SwiftUI. It is a framework that simplifies work for iOS developers. Yet it cannot be used in every situation as [explains Tomek Lizer](/blog/falling-in-love-with-programming-again-tomek-ios-developer/#if-you-had-to-start-an-ios-project-from-scratch-with-no-technological-debt-what-tools-would-you-use), a Senior iOS Developer at Bright Inventions:

<blockquote><div>If it is a solution for a large group of users with a spectrum of Apple devices, then you can’t choose only Swift UI. No matter how trendy it is right now. Yet if the product targets a smaller group of tech-savvy users I would base it on Swift UI. Having in mind that it is still a young technology, you cannot cross off good old UIKit completely.</div><footer>Tomasz Lizer, Senior iOS Developer</footer></blockquote>

So remember to adjust trendy tools to your product and target group.

## Hybrid or native mobile app? That is the question…
