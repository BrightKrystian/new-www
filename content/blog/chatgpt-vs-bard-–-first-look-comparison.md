**Google introduced Bard â€“ a rival to ChatGPT. Little do we know about Google's AI chat system. Yet, we can initially compare both AI solutions. The article will be updated. Feel free to bookmark/pocket it for later.**

## Bard vs ChatGPT language models

Bard is powered by [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/). However, ChatGPT is based on [GPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3). What does it mean for us â€“ users? Putting aside technology differences, from users' perspective Bard should provide more up-to-date information.

LaMDA ðŸ‘‰ Provides real-time responses, and has access to up-to-date information and data.

GPT ðŸ‘‰ Donâ€™t provide real-time data. Its knowledge doesnâ€™t go beyond 2021.

For example,

Bard should tell you who won the 2023 Grammy. ChatGPT wonâ€™t give you that information.

## Integration with search engines

Microsoft announced that [Bing will be enhanced with ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/07/microsoft-launches-the-new-bing-with-chatgpt-built-in/). Is it a move that Google was afraid of? Perhaps. The CEO of Google & Alphabet confirmed that [Bard will be integrated with Google's search engine](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1622674382069059591). 

That seems like a powerful advantage to already a giant search engine. Many have tried to overcome Google, but no one succeeded (yet?).
