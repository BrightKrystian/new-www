My new teammate, Blazej, [dropped recently on his LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/blazej-dziuk_lets-hope-that-joining-a-bright-team-of-activity-7146093107284017152-SuJJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) some wisdom about millennials dreaming of pubs and restaurants, while Gen Z sets their sights on IT startups. As a former restaurant owner turned IT aficionado, let me share some life and business lessons that the recent year (and a few before it, let's be real) taught me.

**Lesson 1: Cut the Clutter**

Identify the tasks that truly matter; it's like Marie Kondo-ing your schedule. Overcommitting leads to stress and burnout. Prioritize, reduce clutter, and deliver higher-quality results. Simple math: more energy on fewer things equals better results.

**Lesson 2: Set a Goal**

"If a man does not know to which port he is sailing, no wind is favourable." - Seneca. This is one of my favourite quotes. Clear goals are like a GPS for your business but also a personal life.

**Lesson 3: Do Not Rush**

Haste makes waste, (my favourable ‚ÄúPo≈õpiech Poni≈ºa‚Äù in Polish) both in life and business. Rushed products and unplanned restaurant menus lead to dissatisfaction. Jumping from one relationship to another? Bugs in your app just to meet a deadline? That's a no-go zone.

**Lesson 4: Make a Plan**

Creating a plan nurtures a particular mindset, preparing you to overcome potential challenges and honing your self-efficacy‚Äîa psychological asset. Albert Bandura's self-efficacy theory centers on the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or tasks. Anticipate hiccups because life loves to throw curveballs. If self-doubt creeps in, dive deeper into [Bandura's theory](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/news/pdfs/Bandura%201977.pdf) or jump into [its highlights](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/click-here-for-happiness/202209/5-ways-to-boost-self-efficacy). 

**Lesson 5: Drop an Anchor**

Feeling off? Reflect.The anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where individuals heavily rely on the first piece of information they encounter when making decisions or judgments. This initial information acts as an 'anchor' and influences subsequent thoughts and evaluations, even if the anchor is unrelated or arbitrary. If you are feeling anxious and dissatisfied about your current situation, reflect on what could have gone wrong but didn't. Reflect on what went right, develop a positive mindset, and sail smoothly.

**Lesson 6: Give Your Ideas a Reality Check**

Back in 1950, it took almost 50 years for medical know-how to double up. Fast forward to 1980, and it squeezed down to 7 years. By 2010, we're talking a mere 3 and a half years. Loads of examples show that sticking rigidly to old rules can cost big bucks (RIP BlackBerry). And hey, this isn't just a business thing‚Äîit spills over into our personal lives too.

**Lesson 7: Step out of Your Comfort Zone**

I've said it before in my [previous blogpost](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/stepping-out-of-your-comfort-zone/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=newblog) and I'll say it again: get uncomfortable sometimes. That's where the magic happens.

**Lesson 8: Don't Deny Yourself Because of a Failure**

Mistakes happen. Learn, transform, and keep going. Life is about growth, not perfection.

So, whether you're dreaming of coding the next big thing or running the coziest pub in town, these lessons are your secret sauce for success. Cheers to the startup life! üöÄüçª\
