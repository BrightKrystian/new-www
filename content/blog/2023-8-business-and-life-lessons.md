My teammate, B≈Ça≈ºej, recently [shared on his LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/blazej-dziuk_lets-hope-that-joining-a-bright-team-of-activity-7146093107284017152-SuJJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) some wisdom about millennials dreaming of pubs and restaurants, while Gen Z sets their sights on IT startups. üòâ As a former restaurant owner turned IT representative, let me share some life and business lessons that the recent year (and a few before it, let's be real) has taught me.

## **Lesson 1: Cut the Clutter**

Identify the tasks that truly matter; it's like Marie Kondo-ing your schedule. Overcommitting leads to stress and burnout. **Prioritize, declutter, and achieve better results**‚Äîthis applies not only to your tasks but also to your relationships with people. Simple math: more energy on fewer things equals better results.

## **Lesson 2: Set a Goal**

<div className="image">![seneca quote](../../static/images/blog-seneca.png "")</div>

**"If a man does not know to which port he is sailing, no wind is favourable."** - Seneca. This is one of my favourite quotes. Clear goals are like a GPS for your business but also a personal life.

## **Lesson 3: Do Not Rush**

Haste makes waste, (my favourable ‚Äúpo≈õpiech poni≈ºa‚Äù in Polish) both in life and business. **Rushed products and unplanned restaurant menus lead to dissatisfaction.** Jumping from one relationship to another? Bugs in your app just to meet a deadline? That's a no-go zone.

## **Lesson 4: Make a Plan**

Creating a plan nurtures a particular mindset, preparing you to overcome potential challenges and honing your **self-efficacy‚Äîa psychological asset**. Albert Bandura's self-efficacy theory centers on the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or tasks. Be ready to have a plan B because life surprises. If self-doubt creeps in, dive deeper into [Bandura's theory](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/news/pdfs/Bandura%201977.pdf) or jump into [its key insights](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/click-here-for-happiness/202209/5-ways-to-boost-self-efficacy).

## **Lesson 5: Drop an Anchor**

Feeling off? Reflect. **The anchoring bias** is a cognitive bias where individuals heavily rely on the first piece of information they encounter when making decisions or judgments. This initial information acts as an 'anchor' and influences subsequent thoughts and evaluations, even if the anchor is unrelated or arbitrary. If you are feeling anxious and dissatisfied about your current situation, **reflect on what could have gone wrong but didn't.** Reflect on what went right, develop a positive mindset, and sail smoothly.

## **Lesson 6: Give Your Ideas a Reality Check**

Back in 1950, it took almost 50 years for medical know-how to double up. Fast forward to 1980, and it squeezed down to 7 years. By 2010, we're talking a mere 3 and a half years. **Loads of examples show that sticking to old rules can cost big money** (RIP BlackBerry). And hey, this isn't just a business thing‚Äîit spills over into our personal lives too!

## **Lesson 7: Step out of Your Comfort Zone**

<div className="image">![out of comfort zone](../../static/images/leonardo.jpeg "")</div>

I've said it before in my [previous blogpost](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/stepping-out-of-your-comfort-zone/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=newblog) and I'll say it again: **get uncomfortable sometimes.** That's where the magic happens.

## **Lesson 8: Don't Deny Yourself Because of a Failure**

Mistakes happen. Learn, transform, and keep going. **Life is about growth, not perfection.**

So, whether you're dreaming of coding the next big thing, developing an international company or running the coziest pub in town, these lessons might be a part of your recipe for success. Cheers to the startup life! üöÄüçª
