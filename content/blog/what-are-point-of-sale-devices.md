## What is an ePOS system?

Point of Sale (POS) is the checkout for customers who purchase goods or services. It is the place to execute the payment. **Modern ePOS (electronic Point of Sale) is a combination of hardware and software that enable transactions**.

In this article, we focus on hardware solutions that are a part of modern ePOS for retail and restaurants.

## What devices are part of the electronic Point of Sale System?

### POS Desktops:

* The core of ePOS systems - **double screen devices enabling managing orders in restaurants**. One screen is facing the customer to display the order. Another one is used by the cash employee to optimize the order and finalize the transaction.
* Displays are only a part of it. ePOS desktops have built-in printers, cameras (normal and face recognition cameras), speakers, and NFC&MSR card readers.
* **The core of ePOS are applications** developed entirely for retail purposes. Thanks to the app the employee creates an order, conducts the payment, and then the order is transferred to the kitchen with its own meal displaying system.
* ePOS devices can work on Android and iOS systems as well. If you go for iOS, you just have to work with iPads. Android is an open-source OS. So many producers build devices for ePOS with Android. Global POS manufacturers are for example Sunmi, Anypos, or POS-X.
