**A smaller budget at the beginning of your startup story may help you build the project with bigger chances of succeeding. How come? Check out why a smaller budget can enhance creativity, simplicity, and data-driven development.**

## A low budget helps to make rational decisions while building MVP

### 1. Choose only crucial features, not every feature you’d love to have.

Sometimes, CTOs and startup founders forget that building MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is not about delivering a perfect solution that has it all. At the beginning of the development process, you should choose only key features to include in your MVP. It helps you to limit your spending on software development.

Remember that there is no guarantee that your MVP will be a success. The advantage of an MVP is its **short time to market – you can quickly and affordably verify your MVP** with users and start making data-driven decisions. **MVP is to learn from data and adopt**.

**A small budget won't let you succumb to the temptation to overbuild your MVP**. Sometimes, the features you build will not be appreciated by users. Therefore you might need to change your strategy or even give up on your idea with – hopefully – big lessons for the future.

### 2. You don’t necessarily need two apps for both stores.

Are you experiencing a smaller budget for mobile development? How about building an app only for one operating system? Just like Instagram did. They launched their app first on the App Store. Sometimes it’s **worth focusing on one platform** in the initial phase.

Or consider **going for hybrid app development**. With tools like Flutter or React Native, you can build one app for both ecosystems. Although these [cross-platform apps carry some limitations](/blog/native-app-development-vs-cross-platform/), they can be a viable solution for a startup with a small budget.
