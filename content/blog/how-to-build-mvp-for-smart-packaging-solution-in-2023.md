To provide a comparison, one market that has a similar size to the projected smart packaging market size is the global digital signage market. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital signage market size was estimated at USD 16.3 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 27.8 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 11.2% during the forecast period.

Both the smart packaging and digital signage markets are driven by advancements in technology, changing consumer behavior, and the need for businesses to enhance their customer engagement and experience. However, it is important to note that the two markets serve different purposes and cater to different industries. Smart packaging is primarily used in the food and beverage, healthcare, and consumer goods sectors, whereas digital signage is utilized in retail, hospitality, transportation, and other sectors.
