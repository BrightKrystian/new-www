## Smart packaging definition and market size

Smart packaging refers to packaging that is designed with advanced technologies to provide additional features such as information, monitoring, and security. 

According to [Acumen Research and Consulting](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/02/22/2612787/0/en/Active-Smart-and-Intelligent-Packaging-Market-Size-Growing-at-8-3-CAGR-Set-to-Reach-USD-29-4-Billion-By-2032.html#:~:text=The%20Global%20Active%2C%20Smart%20And%20Intelligent%20Packaging%20Market%20Size%20in,at%20a%20CAGR%20of%208.3%25), The Global Smart Packaging Market Size in 2022 stood at USD 12.2 Billion and is set to reach USD 29.4 Billion by 2032.

To provide a comparison, one market that has a similar size to the projected smart packaging market size is the global digital signage market. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital signage market size was estimated at USD 16.3 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 27.8 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 11.2% during the forecast period.

Both the smart packaging and digital signage markets are driven by advancements in technology, changing consumer behavior, and the need for businesses to enhance their customer engagement and experience. However, it is important to note that the two markets serve different purposes and cater to different industries. Smart packaging is primarily used in the food and beverage, healthcare, and consumer goods sectors, whereas digital signage is utilized in retail, hospitality, transportation, and other sectors.

## Why you should build MVP for Smart Packaging

When building an innovation you can never be sure if it adopts in the market. That’s why it is better to build a low-cost and fast MVP to minimize the risk of an unsuccessful investment.

An MVP, short for a Minimum Viable Product, is a software product that includes only the essential features necessary for launching and obtaining initial feedback from early adopters. It serves as a starting point for further development based on the insights gained from early users.

## Top benefits of building an MVP for a smart packaging startup

These are the benefits you should consider:

### Validate your idea

MVP lets you validate your assumptions about the target audience in a timely and low-cost manner. If the MVP turns out not to be successful, you can quickly rethink your strategy and adjust it to meet users' expectations. When the MVP proves to be a success, then you know you are going in the right direction and can simply keep working.

### Reducing costs

MVP is an investment in the base of your product. Choosing to build only crucial features helps to reduce costs. A low budget can actually be an advantage for startups. How come? It helps you rationally choose the key features of your solution. It motivates software developers to seek effective, low-cost solutions to any technical challenge. In the end, it protects startups from losing all their resources on a product that won’t attract users.

### Short time to market

The smart packaging industry is rapidly evolving, and building an MVP can help you stay ahead of the curve by allowing you to quickly test new technologies and features. Building MVP is a matter of weeks, so you can really quickly show your product to the market.

### Iterative Development

By building an MVP, you can continually test and improve your product, allowing you to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. This iterative development process can help you create a more robust and successful product in the long run.

## Problems that smart packaging MVP can offer solutions for

Examples of problems smart packaging innovations can address:

### Supply chain inefficiency

Smart packaging has the potential to revolutionize the supply chain by providing real-time information about products' location, condition, and integrity. By building an MVP, you can quickly demonstrate the value of your product to potential partners and investors in the logistics industry, helping to drive adoption and create a more efficient supply chain.

### Food and packaging waste

Smart packaging can help reduce waste by extending the shelf life of perishable goods and preventing product spoilage. It also helps to reduce plastic waste. Single-use plastic containers, wrappings, etc. create unimaginable waste. By building an MVP, you can demonstrate the impact of your product on waste reduction, helping to position your startup as a leader in sustainability.

### Lack of traceability and security

Smart packaging can also improve product traceability and security by providing a tamper-evident seal and tracking information throughout the supply chain. By building an MVP, you can demonstrate the value of your product to potential partners and investors, helping to drive adoption and create a more secure supply chain.
