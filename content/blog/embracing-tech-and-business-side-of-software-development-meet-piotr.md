## Before you joined Bright Inventions you were an entrepreneur. Tell us more about your business.

The company I co-founded was providing **digital signage solutions**. In practice, we owned a nationwide screen network, used as an information and advertisement tool. Our top product was a digital signage network in the health sector. My business partner was responsible for advertising, while **I was handling the technology side of the business**.

## Did your business eventually direct you toward Android development?

Answering that question isn't straightforward. To begin, I should mention that **I am a sound engineer by profession**. I graduated from Gdansk University of Technology. Despite taking on some work at a Musical Theatre in Gdynia and in a recording studio, I found that it wasn't a promising career path for me. I decided to pivot. I've always loved computers - as a teenager, I was building websites with HTML and PHP, so programming wasn't unfamiliar to me.

**My interest was sparked by Android development when I realized how easily it synced with my other passion â€“ playing drums**. Smartphones have accelerometers and track motions like shaking, tilting, and swinging. I read on the internet about a guy who used that to build an app that simulates drums. Being a drummer myself, this intrigued me, so **I decided to develop an app that turned my phone into a drumstick**. It was incredibly satisfying and fun.

Later, I took several courses on Android development. Eventually, my company received an order to build an Android app for a bank, providing me with the opportunity to work on a commercial project.

## How did you land in Bright Inventions?

I sold my business and chose to freelance for a while and work on my own apps. In the end, freelancing wasn't the perfect solution for me, as I love to work in a team, so I began searching for a full-time job. 

I recall coming across a job offer from Bright Inventions on a job board, but I didn't apply at that time. Soon after that, I heard wonderful things about Bright Inventions (and [Ula](/about-us/ula/) in particular) from a friend, so I decided to submit my application. This happened over four years ago. ðŸ™‚ Now I cannot imagine another career path for me.
