**Heavy data, simplicity, clarity. Can we include all of these in healthcare app designs? Are you planning to hire a software development company to design and build your healthcare or medical solution? Check out the UX design challenges that you might face developing eHealth applications. Eventually, find out how to design medical data in a UX-friendly way.**

## Designing data for eHealth applications

In some cases, healthcare apps have to provide users with lots of information. As an example let’s work on a hypothetical app for hospital staff whose purpose is to help manage patients' medicine distribution. 

**In the case of healthcare apps, there is usually a lot of information that has to be designed in a way that is visible and accessible within a few taps or clicks.**

## Challenges for healthcare UX design

Designing the eHealth app for hospital staff requires dealing with these challenges:

* How to prioritize information?
* How to display data in the most accessible way, preferably on the main screen so users don’t have to look for it on different screens?
* How to display all necessary information about patients on a tablet and even on a smartphone?

For the purpose of this blog post, we created a hypothetical mockup for an app for doctors and nurses working at the hospital. This is the possible answer to all of these challenges:

“Wow, that's a lot of information on one screen…” That is something that you could think of looking at the design. You instantly notice that this is not a nice lifestyle app that is supposed to attract you with a fancy design and a small amount of text.

Remember we are talking about an app for hospital employees and we need to meet their requirements. According to our research made while working on various eHealth products, **the number 1 priority for eHealth app users is fast access to all necessary information** thus they should be visible on one screen. In this case, doctors and nurses have access to patients’ names, rooms, and medicine distribution statuses on one screen.
