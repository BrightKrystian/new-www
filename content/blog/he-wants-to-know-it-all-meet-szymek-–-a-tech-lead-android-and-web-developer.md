**Android, iOS, web ‚Äì Szymek tried it all and still wants to learn more. One day he was a team member and on another a leader of that team. Was it a difficult transition? Why Android development is so satisfying to him? What is the best way to convince a Java dev to switch to Kotlin? Find answers to all these questions. This is the story of Szymek ‚Äì a Tech Lead of the Android Team at Bright Inventions.**

## You are an Android & Web Developer. How did that happen?

When I started my career I didn‚Äôt know which technology to choose. I just wanted to join the software development industry so I accepted the first job offer I got. As it happened, that was a fullstack position. Thus I had the opportunity to learn technologies such as **Java, Spring, Angular, and Kotlin**.

I call myself a software agency person. I only worked in agencies where you often switch from one project to another or work for a couple of clients at once. This gave me many opportunities to learn various languages, libraries, etc. 

I guess **I always wanted to explore as many aspects of programming as I possibly could**. Knowing a lot of technologies gives me comprehensive knowledge about end-to-end implementation capabilities. I can choose between solutions more easily as I know a lot of options available for other platforms like web, backend, etc.

Apart from Java and Kotlin, I also programmed in Swift for a couple of months to have that experience. I also tried PHP but this was a one-sided friendship which I didn't reciprocate.

## **So I guess you studied Informatics?**

Actually, I didn‚Äôt. üôÇ I studied Control Engineering at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. I went to college exclusively to figure out what I wanted to do in life. As it turned out it wasn't Control Engineering after all. üòâ

## What was one of the first commercial projects you worked on?

There is one project I particularly remember because it involved AI which was definitely something unique for me ‚Äì a junior developer at that time. It was an **application for therapists which offered patients‚Äô face mimics and emotion recognition during online sessions**. 

It was a great challenge to work on an AI project as a junior. Although there were libraries that helped us to develop it and the real challenge was something different. Our software had to be developed in a way it wouldn‚Äôt disturb the internet connection between a therapist and a patient. Let‚Äôs not forget that every end-user has different devices, various quality internet connections, etc. So we had to create software that would enable everyone to use our app. That was more challenging than building the face emotions recognition itself.

## Eventually, you joined Bright Inventions. How did your and Bright paths cross?

[≈Åukasz](/about-us/lukasz/), who works at Bright, is my friend from college. He recommended me this place. After graduation, he went straight to Bright and I had a job somewhere else. ≈Åukasz was talking all the time about how great it was at Bright so I eventually applied in 2018.

**When I first came to the office for an interview I instantly felt this warm, cozy atmosphere**. I knew it was something I desired. I got that job and started my work here by programming with React. Then I joined the Android team, but in the meantime, I tried Swift and Node.js. At this moment **Android gives me the best satisfaction**.

## Why do you feel that way about Android development?

Because the effects of my work are tangible. **I can grab my Android device and quickly check the results of the lines of code I have just written**. And it is pretty useful on daily basis, not only at work. There were often situations when I couldn‚Äôt find a suitable app so I just wrote something for myself. For example, in college, I built my own flashcard app to improve my learning method. 

Not only Android is satisfying like that. **I feel the same about the front end** (mobile and web as well). Simply because you can check out the UI changes you have made. You can simply click through them. The backend doesn‚Äôt work like that, it is not that easy to experience the results of your actions. 

## Now you are a tech lead of the Android team. What did your road from dev to lead look like?

Since the beginning of my career, I had a chance to learn many different technologies. Remember, I started as a fullstack, and learned Android, Swift, and even PHP on the way. I still didn‚Äôt feel like that was it for me. **Even though Android gives me the most satisfaction I constantly look for other options**.

So I couldn't say ‚Äòno‚Äô when the opportunity to become a tech lead came up. Before that, we had worked as a team without a tech lead but then the structure changed and we needed a tech leader. I figured I wanted to grow and find new things to learn so **becoming a tech lead could give me a new perspective on programming from the management side**.
