## You are an Android & Web Developer. How did that happen?

When I started my career I didn‚Äôt know which technology to choose. I just wanted to join the software development industry so I accepted the first job offer I got. As it happened, that was a fullstack position. Thus I had the opportunity to learn technologies such as **Java, Spring, Angular, and Kotlin**.

I call myself a software agency person. I only worked in agencies where you often switch from one project to another or work for a couple of clients at once. This gave me many opportunities to learn various languages, libraries, etc. 

I guess **I always wanted to explore as many aspects of programming as I possibly could**. Knowing a lot of technologies gives me comprehensive knowledge about end-to-end implementation capabilities. I can choose between solutions more easily as I know a lot of options available for other platforms like web, backend, etc.

Apart from Java and Kotlin, I also programmed in Swift for a couple of months to have that experience. I also tried PHP but this was a one-sided friendship which I didn't reciprocate.

## **So I guess you studied Informatics?**

Actually, I didn‚Äôt. üôÇ I studied Control Engineering at the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. I went to college exclusively to figure out what I wanted to do in life. As it turned out it wasn't Control Engineering after all. üòâ

## What was one of the first commercial projects you worked on?

There is one project I particularly remember because it involved AI which was definitely something unique for me ‚Äì a junior developer at that time. It was an **application for therapists which offered patients‚Äô face mimics and emotion recognition during online sessions**. 

It was a great challenge to work on an AI project as a junior. Although there were libraries that helped us to develop it and the real challenge was something different. Our software had to be developed in a way it wouldn‚Äôt disturb the internet connection between a therapist and a patient. Let‚Äôs not forget that every end-user has different devices, various quality internet connections, etc. So we had to create software that would enable everyone to use our app. That was more challenging than building the face emotions recognition itself.

## Eventually, you joined Bright Inventions. How did your and Bright paths cross?

[≈Åukasz](/about-us/lukasz/), who works at Bright, is my friend from college. He recommended me this place. After graduation, he went straight to Bright and I had a job somewhere else. ≈Åukasz was talking all the time about how great it was at Bright so I eventually applied in 2018.

**When I first came to the office for an interview I instantly felt this warm, cozy atmosphere**. I knew it was something I desired. I got that job and started my work here by programming with React. Then I joined the Android team, but in the meantime, I tried Swift and Node.js. At this moment **Android gives me the best satisfaction**.

## Why do you feel that way about Android development?

Because the effects of my work are tangible. **I can grab my Android device and quickly check the results of the lines of code I have just written**. And it is pretty useful on daily basis, not only at work. There were often situations when I couldn‚Äôt find a suitable app so I just wrote something for myself. For example, in college, I built my own flashcard app to improve my learning method. 

Not only Android is satisfying like that. **I feel the same about the front end** (mobile and web as well). Simply because you can check out the UI changes you have made. You can simply click through them. The backend doesn‚Äôt work like that, it is not that easy to experience the results of your actions. 

## Now you are a tech lead of the Android team. What did your road from dev to lead look like?

Since the beginning of my career, I had a chance to learn many different technologies. Remember, I started as a fullstack, and learned Android, Swift, and even PHP on the way. I still didn‚Äôt feel like that was it for me. **Even though Android gives me the most satisfaction I constantly look for other options**.

So I couldn't say ‚Äòno‚Äô when the opportunity to become a tech lead came up. Before that, we had worked as a team without a tech lead but then the structure changed and we needed a tech leader. I figured I wanted to grow and find new things to learn so **becoming a tech lead could give me a new perspective on programming from the management side**.

## One day you were a team member, another a tech lead. Was it challenging to establish yourself in the new role?

It wasn‚Äôt as problematic as you might think. My whole transition from a developer to a tech leader was a rather smooth one. It wasn't a drastic change made over a night. **During the first 2-3 months my responsibilities were just starting to clarify**. Meanwhile, the whole dynamics in the team were developing. In my view, **everyone was adjusting slowly and with no pressure**. That was the perfect way to do it. 

## What are your daily duties and responsibilities as a tech lead?

I start my workday by responding to every Slack message, Jira comment, and email. ;) As soon as I get through all of that I can focus on managing current challenges in the project and taking care of the team productivity. 

I spend some time coding and overlooking new features being released. Yet apart from delivering new features, **my priority is to prevent bad decisions** that could reduce the quality of the product. I am **accountable for keeping a high quality of the app**. I am also **responsible for reducing technical debt and keeping the stack up-to-date**.  

An important part of my job is to **establish the right duties for every developer within the team**. So they feel responsible for specific areas. **As a tech lead, I really need to know my team members well enough to get which areas of mobile development are their things, and which tasks will be of value to them and to the whole project**. I mean all of us in the team have to develop our Android skills holistically. Yet in the end, everyone has some areas that are simply closer to their heart. Some enjoy UI test automation, another would rather focus on databases. So my job as a tech lead is to work out with every developer the best possible tasks for them. And if some task could be a challenge we might go for pair programming so two people could together work out some issues.

## How does your team respond to that?

I work in **a very mature team where everyone understands their responsibilities and is simply passionate about their job**. I have to always stay up-to-date with the technologies but I also know that other team members also track every news, update, new library, etc. Android development is just a passion of ours. 

We also have regular meetings at Bright for all Android devs where we do not talk about our projects but simply gather online to discuss new trends, and share experiences from recent tests of new libraries, features, etc. **Every team member can propose improvements that would reduce technical debt and improve our project**. 

## Is there anything more you have to take care of?

Moreover, as a tech lead, **I have to create an environment for devs that guarantees time and space to do their job.** üôÇ Usually, a programmer needs to focus on one task at a time to finish it effectively. They shouldn‚Äôt be distracted by messages, instant requests, and other random stuff. 

I make sure that their workflow isn‚Äôt disturbed a lot. Business representatives know that in order to make the work smooth for everyone they should contact me and then I can work out any issue with developers in a way I don‚Äôt interfere with their other duties. Micromanagement is not our style. We are responsible human beings. Therefore **we trust each other and don‚Äôt interfere with anyone‚Äôs way of work**. 

## How many people are on your Android team?

At the moment I have **10 people on my team**. We create an international group of people. Most of the developers are from Poland, but we also have devs from Israel and The Republic of South Africa.

## You are a Kotlin enthusiast. What is the quickest way to convince Java developers to switch to Kotlin?

The easiest way to convince a Java dev to use Kotlin is to o**ffer to buy them a beer on the condition that they spend an hour to code in Kotlin**. They will quickly realize what pain was it to code in Java over these years. And will come back to me with gratitude and probably a beer bought for me. üôÇ

On a more serious note, a great way is to show examples of differences between Java and Kotlin. Let me show you **the code needed to create a ‚ÄúPigeon‚Äù class in both languages**:

**Java**

```
public class Pigeon {
    String name;
    String color;

    public Pigeon(String name, String color) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Pigeon pigeon = (Pigeon) o;
        return Objects.equals(name, pigeon.name) && Objects.equals(color, pigeon.color);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, color);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Pigeon{" +
                "name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", color='" + color + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```
data class Pigeon(
    val name: String, 
    val color: String
)
```

Can you see a difference? üòâ
