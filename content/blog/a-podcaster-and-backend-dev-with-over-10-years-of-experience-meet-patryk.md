What are his career beginnings? Why can’t he work without wearing slippers? Check out the story of Patryk, a Backend Developer and a host of the #brightdevtalks podcast.**

## Last year you had your 10th anniversary as a software developer. Do you feel like an IT dinosaur?

If I had done things I did 10 years ago, I would have felt like that. But I don’t. Software development changes so dynamically that even if you started this career line 10 years ago you still have to learn new things all the time. When it comes to learning new languages you can sometimes be at the same level as a junior developer (with a small advantage).
