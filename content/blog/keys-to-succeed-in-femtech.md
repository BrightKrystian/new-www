## Empathy and data-driven development \[use case: onboarding for an app for pregnant women]

What’s best for FemTech users? Short, easy-to-complete onboarding, or perhaps a long but very personalized one? The answer might surprise you. Short onboarding is often a key to success, especially in lifestyle applications, but this might not be the case in applications related to health.

From the first interactions with your FemTech app, it's crucial to demonstrate the willingness to understand their perspective without making assumptions. Well-designed onboarding will convey this approach to your female users right from their very first interactions.

No matter what onboarding strategy you will choose you should always analyze its performance by measuring the competition rate as a part of data-driven development.
