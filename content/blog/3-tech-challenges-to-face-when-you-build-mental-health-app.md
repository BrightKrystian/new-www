**Building a mental health app differs from other software products. Are you planning to hire a software agency to develop your app for emotional support? Make sure that you know the technical challenges you and your team will likely face.**

Numbers aren’t optimistic. [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression) estimated that **280 million people around the world suffer from depression**. Putting that in perspective – it’s around 80% of the population of the USA. Moreover, at least **[25% of people](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/glob114104_future-of-behavioral-health/GLOB114104_Future-of-behavioral-health.pdf) will experience behavioral illness**. 

*More of that was covered in our blog post about [the future of healthcare software](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/healthcare-software-development-not-a-future/).*

Probably no public health system will be able to respond to those needs. Therefore **the number of mental health applications will be increasing**. 

As software developers specializing in building apps for depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders we have distinguished **3 challenges that every emotional support app team will likely face**.

## Data security and privacy

**Dominik, Frontend Developer at Bright Inventions:**

Privacy of personal information has always been a serious topic in software development. Yet it is especially important in the case of data connected to personal health. Every **data leak is a potential complete loss of trust in a company**.

Moreover, it can be extra catastrophic when taking into account the fact that in many countries **health information privacy is protected by law**. 

There are also challenges regarding **anonymity**. Not every user wants to share everything about themselves with other users. We might need their first and last name for payment purposes but they rather not be mentioned by real names inside the app. 

Another thing to keep in mind is if we accept **payments with credit cards**. What will the credit card statement show? Some users might not be willing to share information that they’re using a mental health help with people who have access to their credit card statement – a spouse or parents.
