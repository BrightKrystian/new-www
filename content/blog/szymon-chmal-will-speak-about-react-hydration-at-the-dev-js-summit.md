## Szymon’s talk – The New Face of Hydration

If you are creating applications in React, you have probably encountered the concept of hydration. The bright side of this process is that our application, initially rendered on the server side, becomes interactive. Not long ago, hydration had to be performed in an "all or nothing" mode and often became noticeable to the end user. Fortunately, the situation has changed with the latest version of React. Hydration can now be divided into phases and even prioritized. What exactly does this mean? You will find out during this presentation.

**Szymon will uncover the new face of hydration on October 12 at 2.30 p.m. online. [Claim your spot now](https://devjssummit.pl/)!**
