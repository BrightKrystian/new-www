## Rustification of web development

[Szymon, Senior Frontend Developer](/about-us/szymon-ch/):

The truth is **the times of simple websites are long over**. Now, it’s a reign of complex web applications. Thousands of source code files have to be processed in order to produce an experience users love so much. The problem is, **tools like Babel or Webpack seem to have reached their limits** and can no longer offer a good developer experience. But fear not! 

There is a new generation of build tools storming the market and gaining more and more popularity. **It all started last year with the Next.js 12 release and their transition from Babel to SWC**. This year, they announced a Rust-based bundler, which promises to be hundreds of times faster than its JavaScript counterpart. I must admit, we all loved to hear that! Furthermore, **Rust can be compiled into WebAssembly and run natively**. This brings a huge performance boost if we don’t have a choice and have to make complex calculations in a browser.

In my opinion, **there are good chances Rust will become a cornerstone of modern web development next year**. The frenzy is just beginning. Other tools like TypeScript compiler will take part in it and more companies will invest in such innovations. This momentum cannot be reduced now as it’s far too late. I think it’s the most exciting shift in the industry since the popularization of frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue and Angular.

It all sounds so good, but **should I start learning Rust**? To be honest, I have already started.
