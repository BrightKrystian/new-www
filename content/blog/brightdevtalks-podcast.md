[Patryk](/about-us/patryk-sz/) is a Bright Senior Backend Developer with over 10 years of experience. He decided that it was high time to share his knowledge with others. And we couldnâ€™t agree more.

**So here we are with a brand new brightdevtalks podcast which is available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts (only in Polish).** Soon will be available on Apple Podcasts and Prime Music.
