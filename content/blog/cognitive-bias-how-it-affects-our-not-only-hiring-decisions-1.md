Cognitive bias very often creeps into our daily communication and hiring process subconsciously and unexpectedly. It may occur when we “trust our gut” or just “follow our intuition” ignoring significant insights and not using critical thinking. What might be scary is that unconscious bias is really hard to identify and it does much harm to our daily life. **If it comes to the recruitment area, the consequence might be hiring someone who is not as engaged as we expected, choosing a candidate with not appropriate skillset for the role or not giving a chance to a real talent.** 

In all areas of our work cognitive bias leads to many misunderstandings, conflicts or professional failures. It makes us overlook some crucial information in favour of the beliefs we hold. As it was said this is an unconscious process and in most cases we are not aware we exhibit a particular kind of thinking tendency. However, noticing certain examples of bias can help you identify factors that may have an impact on your decisions. **Understanding what type of bias you are dealing with can be important to both your professional and personal development. Below you can find the most common 13 types of cognitive bias occurring not only in hiring process, but also in daily communication.** 

## 1. **Confirmation bias**

The tendency to search for and focus on the information that will confirm our prior belief, opinion or expectation. **Due to the conformation bias we tend to listen only to the information that confirm our viewpoint which makes us think everyone who disagrees with us must be wrong, misinformed or irrational.** The more we are affected by confirmation bias, the less likely we want to listen to people with opposing views.

## 2. **Fundamental attribution bias** 

The tendency to explain a person's behaviour by referring to their personality rather than any situational factors like social and environmental forces. **We often assume that someone’s actions depend on what "kind" of person they are. What is interesting, if it comes to our own action we often view them as affected by the environment.** For example if you fail to meet a deadline in a project, you may assume that it was because of the client’s changing requirements, not enough support from the team etc. But if it was your colleague who did not finish the task on time, the assumptions might be completely different i.e due to their incompetence, poor time management or laziness. 

## **3. Halo & Horn Effect**

A type of bias that is formed when we take one trait of a person and make it either “the halo” or “the horn” and then it becomes the root of our all further judgments. **If we notice one good thing about an individual, we often assume them to be “good” also regarding other things. And when we notice one bad thing about a person, we assume her/him to be bad when it comes to other things.** The example might the first impression of a candidate who takes part in an interview. If we are not aware of the halo/horn effect, the first impression may overshadow the candidate’s positive or negative attributes. For instance a recruiter may see a photo on the resume presenting a sad grimace which may cause inaccurate negative assumptions about the candidate’s negative attitude to life.

## 4. **Salience bias**

It is human’s tendency to focus on the most easily recognisable features and casting aside those that lack prominence. If an element or some informations seems to stand out, it is salient. **Salient means most noticeable, prominent or important.** The salient elements make it easy for people to process the information (cognitive ease).In a recruitment process elements like education, some personal traits or just hobbies may make our experience salient. In consequence, recruiters are likely to omit some really crucial informations of the candidates and end up making decisions that may not be the best. 

## 5. **Anchoring bias**

An inclination to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we are given about some topic. **The anchor is a very strong starting point that may affect your final decision. In hiring process the anchoring bias may occur for instance during resumes screening.** The recruiter while reviewing candidate’s CVs may notice a postgraduate diploma from a recognisable university and even if it is not a job requirement it may become an anchoring point for reviewing the rest of candidates. **In everyday life we experience anchoring bias very often while shopping and making buying decisions.**
