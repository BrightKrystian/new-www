Remote patient monitoring (RPM) can lead to significant cost savings in healthcare. An essential part of RPM is healthcare smart devices including wearables that monitor patients' vital signs. Empowered with healthcare software applications devices help doctors, nurses, and patients to better manage their conditions, leading to reduced hospital visits and improved management of chronic diseases.

## Healthcare devices that enable remote patient monitoring:

Check out devices that are part of the digital transformation in healthcare.

### Pulse oximeter

![Pulse oximeter](../../static/images/blogpost_www_pulse_oximeter.png)

* It monitors the oxygen saturation of the patient’s blood and displays the percentage of blood loaded with oxygen.
* The device has become popular during the pandemic because it is a fast and simple method to calculate the risk of COVID-19 infection. 
* For one of our clients, we connect oximeters with a dedicated app that process the data about the patient’s oxygen saturation and analyze them. We’ve developed an algorithm that verifies if the patient’s condition requires any ambulance assistance. Also, the data about the patient saturation can be sent to a doctor who monitors the condition of the patient.

### Bluetooth Thermometer

* Another healthcare device that has become crucial during the pandemic.
* Modern thermometer devices not only read a patient's temperature remotely but also send the data to the app that evaluates them.

### Sphygmomanometer

* It is a well-known blood pressure monitor.
* Modern versions of these devices can connect to the app which enables sending the data about blood pressure to the medical staff.

### Spirometer

![Spirometer](../../static/images/blogpost_www_spirometer.png)

* It measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled by human’s lungs.
* It’s another device that helps to diagnose COVID-19 infection. 
* Apart from that, it tests lung functionality, reasons for shortness of breath and other issues related to breathing.
* Modern hand-held spirometers can be used by patients on a daily basis.
* It is a helpful tool, especially for patients with chronic diseases like asthma who have to monitor their condition every day. Thanks to the app connected to the device doctors can monitor a patient's state in real time.

### Stethoscope

![Stethoscope](../../static/images/blogpost_www_stethoscope.png)

* Known as the number one of doctor’s gadgets, it can now be used remotely by other caregivers at care homes and nursing homes. 
* It enables real-time and remote medical examinations that don’t have to be conducted by doctors. Caregivers not only can record a patient’s beating heart but even “broadcast” it live to the doctor.
* Digital stethoscopes gather a very unique set of data which must be verified by doctors. Bluetooth connection enables transferring the data to an app which analyses them and informs a doctor about the results. 

### Wearable vital sign arm monitor

![Wearable continuous monitoring device](../../static/images/blogpost_www_continuous_monitoring_device.png)

* Patients wear a device for example on their arm and doctors as well as caregivers can monitor the vital signs in real-time, 24 hours a day.
* These types of devices are especially beneficial for older patients because they are easy to use. Patients just have to wear it and have the app around.
* They help to prevent circulatory diseases that are [a leading cause of death globally](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)).
* However, they might not be that convenient to wear 24 hours a day compared to other smaller smart devices.

### Smartwatches

* Popular fitness gadget that can also be a part of medical remote care systems.
* They monitor stress levels, movement disorders, sleep tracking, blood pressure, heart disease.
* Due to their widespread popularity, these devices have the potential to evolve from mere fitness trackers to healthcare tools accessible to the masses. However, they may face some competition in this journey.

## Smart healthcare devices of the future

The future of digital health is closely connected with wearable healthcare devices that can non-invasively collect data 24 hours a day. The smaller these devices are, the better. Not only do they tend to have longer battery lives, but research also shows promise in [utilizing human body heat as a power source](https://scitechdaily.com/new-wearable-device-turns-your-body-into-a-biological-battery/).

### Smart rings

* Smart rings seem like smaller versions of smartwatches, but calling them that is an understatement.
* Their discreet form factor and the capability to collect data unobtrusively allow for the capturing of more comprehensive health data.
* Smart rings have also shown promise in areas such as [sign language recognition](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597638.3614491) and the [early detection of COVID-1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/ucsf-launches-study-to-use-wearable-data-from-oura-ring-for-early-covid-19-detection)9 and other viral infections.

### Smart earrings

* Researchers at the University of Washington are developing smart earrings capable of monitoring signs of stress, eating, exercise, and ovulation.
* These earrings continuously measure fever, indicating if the body is fighting an infection.
* Studies show these earrings are more accurate at sensing skin temperature than smartwatches, making them potentially better for measuring ovulation and period tracking. FemTech companies are likely to explore these prototypes for integration with their applications.

Gathering data from these devices isn’t really a challenge. The challenge is to develop the right algorithm that will not only analyse the data but will respond with the solution that may save a life. Healthcare apps that we create can instruct patients and caregivers to call an ambulance. An app can even set up a phone call to 911 and the patient just needs to click to start it.

If you are looking for a **[healthcare software development company](/)**, make sure that the software team that you are about to hire have **deep knowledge about software development as well as experience in hardware**. These two elements are crucial in terms of developing solutions for telehealth.
