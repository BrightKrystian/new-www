## Could you describe your journey into programming?

It began a long time ago, **back in the 1980s**. At that time, **I only had access to 8-bit computers**. I highly enjoyed playing computer games then, but what intrigued me even more was understanding the mechanics behind them. This curiosity led me to **start programming, initially in BASIC**. However, I didn’t think at the time that it would become my future profession. I had many other interests, including radio. I was part of a radio club where we got to work with computers, which was a significant deal during the twilight of communism in Poland. The experience of working with hardware and electronics was truly captivating.

In the 1990s, I worked as a graphic designer, creating posters and other printed materials. As the company I worked at began to expand its portfolio to include web development, I **seized the opportunity to learn Perl and PHP (version 2.0 at the time) as well as Linux**. That marked the start of my career in software development.

## What happened after that?

After that I worked for a small software development company in Poznań, then, I entered a corporate phase, working for global enterprises. I **had an opportunity to spend a month in Silicon Valley, in a building that is now the headquarters of Facebook**. It was on the same campus where **I met legends like James Gosling**, the creator of Java. Back then, it was easy to bump into him in the cafeteria.

Later I even got a chance to live in the U.S for 18 months as an Oracle employee. I worked at its American headquarters. Back then **I spent lots of time at Hacker Dojo – one of the most famous coworking spaces where numerous Silicon Valley unicorns were born**.

Eventually, I left the corporate world but I still cooperated closely with enterprises as a business partner by starting my company and employing a few people to digitize clients' processes. One noteworthy project we undertook was the digitalization of welding processes. We developed an IoT system that modernized welding operations for a chemical engineering company.
