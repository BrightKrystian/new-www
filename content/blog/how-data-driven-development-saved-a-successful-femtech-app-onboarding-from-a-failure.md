**An 80% onboarding conversion rate for a mobile app is generally a successful metric. However, particularly in the world of software development, everything can be optimized. Or maybe not? Follow the story of how the pursuit of optimization, based solely on assumptions, nearly destroyed the successful onboarding of a FemTech app, and discover how we prevented this using the power of data!**

## The hypothesis: simplifying onboarding to increase the app sign-up rate

While scaling the mobile application offering nutrition and fitness recommendations for pregnant women, we focused on key elements that would help attract more soon-to-be moms. One of the aspects was the quality of the app's onboarding process. 

The pregnancy app in question had, at that time, an **onboarding process containing 8 steps, divergently helping the app to customize the experience for its expecting women**. So, there weren't only the typical login screens, but the females also answered a bunch of questions such as:

* name,
* fitness and exercise preferences,
* food preferences,
* allergies.
