## Changes, changes, and changes

**S≈Çawek, Fullstack Developer at Bright Inventions:**

‚ÄúThe Only Constant in Life Is Change.‚Äù ‚Äì this quote by Heraclitus perfectly sums up working for a startup. Basically **every day we should expect some kind of change**. Starting from a slight shift in the requirements of the task we are working on to crossing out the feature which seemed a must-have a few days ago. On top of that, we experience pivots that might result in a total focus change to a completely different part of the app.

While working on a startup project **you have to blaze a trail**. There are no grand rules to follow. Especially when you build innovation. You have to find your way to discover suitable solutions. It requires lots of dedication, time, and money to test different approaches. Naturally, some roads will turn out to be dead ends. 

## Proactivity and constant look for the best solutions

**S≈Çawek:**

While building a startup product you cannot hide behind your code. You are a part of the equation which determines the project‚Äôs success. **As a developer, you have to be proactive**. Proactivity in software development is based on analytical thinking and assertiveness. Why these two exactly? Analytical thinking helps you predict problems and look for better solutions. And sometimes they are opposite to what business wants. Here comes assertiveness.

You are not supposed to do only what the business expects. You should offer your insight and **show them solutions that might be more beneficial for the business**. You need to know how to communicate your proposal to show its value. **Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù is easy, explaining ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù is the real challenge**. If you are proactive like that, then the startup work will suit you.

## Finding a balance between high-quality code and the rate of releasing new features
