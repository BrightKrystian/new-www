**You have an idea, design, and maybe even a software development team to build your mobile application. Still haven't you forgotten about something? What about establishing key targets that you want to achieve? Only then you can verify if your product is successful. Check out how to do that!**

<div class="image"><img src="/images/blogpost_mvp_success.png" alt="MVP success metrics" title="MVP success metrics"  /> </div>

Let’s assume that you chose an Agile way and decided to build [MVP (Minimum Viable Product)](/our-areas/mvp-development/), so you can quickly release your solution and verify it with users. While working on the MVP, **at the very beginning, you should establish your goals and ways to measure them**. Naturally, they can change as the product evolves and you gain a better understanding of the market.

## Examples of MVP success metrics

Here are some MVP success criteria for validation of your MVP, along with recommended tools to help measure them:

### Metric #1: App Download Rate

This metric is crucial for mobile MVPs and indicates how appealing your app is to users and whether your marketing efforts are effective.

To calculate the download rate, use the following formula:

<div class="important-info"><div>App Download Rate (%) = (D / C) x 100</div></div>

This formula measures the percentage of users who completed the download after clicking on the promotion.

Remember that downloading isn’t everything, though. [50% of Android apps are uninstalled within 30 days after the download](https://www.businessofapps.com/news/half-of-android-apps-are-uninstalled-within-30-days-after-download/). If your download rates are satisfactory but the number of active users is extremely low you might deal with a **high uninstalled rate**. 

That’s why the app download rate cannot be measured without the retention rate (keep on reading to discover that).

Tools to track app download rate: 

You can track app downloads using tools provided by well-known mobile app stores: **Google Play Console** for Android apps, and **App Store Connect** for iOS apps.

### Metric #2: User retention rate

It measures what **percentage of users continue to use your app after a given period** such as 30 days after app installation. User retention rate might be a crucial measurement to see if your product has loyal and engaged customers.

To calculate the user retention rate, you can use the following formula:

<div class="important-info"><div>User Retention Rate (%) = \\\[(E - N) / S] x 100 </div></div>

Where:

E: The number of users at the end of a specific period (typically, this is the number of users who were active at the beginning of the period).

N: The number of new users acquired during that period.

S: The number of users at the start of the period.
